note: Chef Donald Link of New Orleans restaurants Cochon and Herbsaint, shared this recipe as part of a special Mardi Gras celebration he created for Epicurious.\nBoudin, the king of Cajun food, is my favorite thing in the world to eat. It is a unique food in that it can be breakfast, lunch, dinner, a snack, or car food. Whereas most of the country might show up at a morning get-together with donuts, we show up with boudin. And no two boudins are exactly alike—that's amazing, considering they all have basically the same ingredients of rice and pork.\nOne of the best boudins I've had is made by my cousin Bubba Frey, who owns the Mowata General Store in the heart of the German settlement between the Link and Zaunbrecher rice fields, but all my cousins down there make their own boudin. One cousin told me that meat from the temple of the pig's head makes the best boudin, while another claims that a combination of hog jowl and shoulder meat is the secret. The truth is, they are all good.\nThis recipe combines elements from all of the different boudins I've eaten in my day. There's liver in it but just enough, it's nicely spiced but wont burn your mouth, and it has the perfect amount of rice.","hed":"My Boudin","pubDate":"2011-12-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Donald Link"},{"name":" Paula Disbrowe"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/my-boudin-388369","photoData":{"id":"54b40dfad5e8c3e1070afc54","filename":"388369_boudin_1x1.jpg","caption":"My Boudin","credit":"Chris Granger","promoTitle":"My Boudin","title":"My Boudin","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.2,"ingredients":["2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes","1/2 pound pork liver, cut into 1-inch cubes","1 small onion, chopped","2 celery stalks, chopped","1 medium poblano chile, stemmed, seeded, and chopped","3 medium jalapeño peppers, stemmed, seeded, and chopped","6 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped","4 tablespoons kosher salt","1 tablespoon ground black pepper","1 tablespoon ground white pepper","1/2 teaspoon curing salt","1 teaspoon cayenne pepper","1 teaspoon chili powder","7 cups cooked white rice","1 cup chopped fresh parsley","1 cup chopped scallions (green and white parts)","4 to 6 feet of sausage casings (optional), rinsed"],"prepSteps":["Combine the pork, liver, vegetables, and seasonings in a bowl and marinate for 1 hour or overnight, covered, in the refrigerator.

Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, mix in the cooked rice, parsley, scallions, and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir vigorously for 5 minutes. When the boudin-rice mixture is first combined, it looks very wet and it's pretty spicy. Don't worry; after poaching, the rice absorbs the excess moisture and much of the spice. The wet texture and extra spice ensure that your final boudin will be moist and full of flavor.","At this point you can feed the sausage into the casings. Poach the links gently in hot (not bubbling) water for about 10 minutes, then serve. Alternatively, you can use the mixture as a stuffing for chicken, or roll it into \"boudin balls,\" dredge in bread crumbs, and fry in hot oil until golden brown."],"reviewsCount":5,"willMakeAgainPct":40},{"id":"54a42ad319925f464b37f12d","dek":"Editor's note: Chef Donald Link of New Orleans restaurants Cochon and Herbsaint, shared this recipe as part of a special Mardi Gras celebration he created for Epicurious.\nChocolate Yummy might not be part of your dessert vernacular, but in Cajun Country, everybody knows what this dish is. The \"yummy\" architecture begins with a base of crumbled cookies (usually store-bought), followed by layers of sweetened cream cheese, chocolate pudding, and Cool Whip. I have a few aunts who specialize in this dessert, so it never fails to conjure up memories of family get-togethers. This is the type of dessert that someone pulls out of the fridge after a big meal or cookout, and even when guests think they're too full, they find themselves polishing off a portion of yummy.\nHere is a grown-up version that's a bit more sophisticated, because I have lost my taste for the super-sweet original. Here, a rich pecan shortbread base is topped with cream cheese, a silky pudding made with dark chocolate, and fresh whipped cream.

These giant parties for adults and kids are all about having a good time, being with friends and family, and eating local food.\nTo boil crawfish you need to have the proper setup—namely a propane tank, a stand to put the pot on, and a very large pot (crawfish are sold in 40-pound sacks). The pot needs to be fitted with a basket so you can pull the crawfish out and add more.\nMy cousin Billy's crawfish are, hands down, the best I've ever tasted. When it comes to cooking crawfish, though, we aren't in total agreement. I like to soak the crawfish in their spicy cooking water; Billy doesn't. Some people prefer to drain the crawfish after they've been soaking in the spicy water for just 5 minutes, then dump them into an ice chest, and season the outside of the crawfish shells heavily. This method keeps the meat from getting overcooked, but the spices end up on your hands, not in the meat. To my mind, \"marinating\" the cooked crawfish in their cooking liquid allows more of the spice and salt to be absorbed by the meat and creates more juice in the heads. (Sucking the juice from the head before you eat the tail is the proper way to eat boiled crawfish.)\nThough no self-respecting party in Cajun Country would cook fewer than two or three sacks, I've given a smaller recipe here.","hed":"Link Family Crawfish Boil","pubDate":"2011-12-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Donald Link"},{"name":" Paula Disbrowe"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/link-family-crawfish-boil-388389","photoData":{"id":"54b40d3ad5e8c3e1070af996","filename":"388389_crawfish-boil_1x1.jpg","caption":"Link Family Crawfish Boil","credit":"Chris Granger","promoTitle":"Link Family Crawfish Boil","title":"Link Family Crawfish Boil","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 pounds salt","8 medium onions, quartered","10 lemons, halved","6 heads of garlic, halved horizontally","1 (4 1/2-pound) bag Louisiana crawfish, shrimp, and crab boil, or an equal amount of Donnie's Spice Mix","3 pounds small red potatoes","8 ears of corn, shucked and cut into thirds","40 pounds medium crawfish"],"prepSteps":["Bring a very large pot of water to a boil over high heat.

It gives you tremendous flavor at an affordable price, a fraction of the cost of a fresh black truffle.","hed":"Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce","pubDate":"2011-12-22T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Alexis Touchet"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/porcini-crusted-beef-tenderloin-with-truffle-butter-sauce-387490","photoData":{"id":"54b42d1ad5e8c3e1070b4473","filename":"387490_beef-tenderloin_1x1.jpg","caption":"Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce","credit":"Chris Gentile","promoTitle":"Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce","title":"Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Beef","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["1 (6- to 6 1/2-pound) whole beef tenderloin, trimmed of fat, silverskin, and the chain (see Cooks' Notes); or a 5- to 5 1/2-pound well-trimmed tenderloin roast","Salt","Freshly ground black pepper","4 tablespoons olive oil, divided","1/2 ounce (about 1/2 cup) dried porcini mushrooms, ground to a powder in a blender","1/4 cup (2 ounces) black-truffle butter, softened","1/4 cup all-purpose flour","1 pound crimini (baby bella) mushrooms, trimmed and quartered into wedges","3 cups beef stock or low-sodium broth, divided","1/2 cup chopped scallion greens","Kitchen string; large heavy roasting pan; instant-read thermometer"],"prepSteps":["Make a deep cut into the top side of tenderloin, about 4 inches from tail end, to facilitate folding the tail end under the roast to give the meat a more uniform thickness.

And \"simple\" is an important descriptor here. Because it's an oil-based cake—like carrot cake—it doesn't involve equipment any more complicated than a whisk and a bowl.\nTwo stealth ingredients make this dessert different: unsweetened coconut milk and instant espresso powder. The former is amazing in its ability to add richness to the cake and stand in for cream in the ganache without overwhelming the dessert with coconut flavor. Espresso powder in the frosting magically highlights the depth of the chocolate.\nBecause this cake happens to be dairy-free, it's perfect for Hanukkah, and a godsend for anyone dealing with lactose intolerance. But the cake is so incredibly delicious, no one will notice the lack of cream and butter. They'll be too busy asking for seconds and thirds.","hed":"Double-Deep-Chocolate Hanukkah Layer Cake","pubDate":"2011-12-22T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Melissa Roberts"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/double-deep-chocolate-hanukkah-layer-cake-387493","photoData":{"id":"54b42cf0d5e8c3e1070b4391","filename":"387493_chocolate-hanukkah-layer-cake_1x1.jpg","caption":"Double-Deep-Chocolate Hanukkah Layer Cake","credit":"Chris Gentile","promoTitle":"Double-Deep-Chocolate Hanukkah Layer Cake","title":"Double-Deep-Chocolate Hanukkah Layer Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chocolate","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.63,"ingredients":["3/4 cup vegetable oil plus more for greasing pans","3/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-process) plus more for dusting pans","1 cup water","3/4 cup well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk","3 large eggs, warmed in shell in warm water 5 minutes","1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","2 cups all-purpose flour","1 3/4 cups sugar","2 teaspoons baking powder","1/2 teaspoon baking soda","3/4 teaspoon salt","1 1/2 cups well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk","24 ounces (4 cups) semisweet chocolate chips (see Cooks' Notes)","2 teaspoons instant espresso powder","1 1/2 tablespoons light corn syrup","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","2 (9-inch) round cake pans (2 inches deep); parchment paper"],"prepSteps":["Heat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
