Among her repertoire were light, slightly tangy cheese dumplings. No one, however, ever wrangled the real recipe from her. Fortunately, I found a number of cooperative cooks who were more than willing to share their recipes with me.\nThese popular dumplings are called topfenknodel in Austria and Germany, turos gomboc in Hungary, syrove knedliky in Czech, and kluski in Poland. Topfen, also called quark in German, is a thick, slightly tangy central European curd cheese popular for making dumplings, spreads, and toppings. Since topfen is generally unavailable in America, a little cream cheese is added to the pot cheese to approximate the original texture and flavor. You can substitute farmer cheese for the pot cheese, but first wrap it in several layers of paper towels, then let it drain for about 10 minutes to extract some of the excess moisture. Do not use cottage cheese, which contains too much liquid and is too firm.

In the classic recipe, all the innards — heart, lungs, and so forth — go into the pot, but they do not really contribute to the taste. The flavor of the stock comes from the boiled head and neck, and the soup gets its distinctive taste from scallions, fresh dill, and the egg-and-lemon mixture.\nThere are lots of different magiritsa recipes. A friend described to me the one her family prepared in Halki, a small island that is part of the Dodecanese. In her family's version, no innards were used because, in Halki as in all the Dodecanese, they do not roast the lamb on the spit but instead stuff it with rice and the innards. So in Halki's magiritsa, many lambs' heads were boiled to make a very tasty stock, to which egg and lemon sauce is added at the end. The heads were not boned, but as they cooked for many hours, even their bones became soft. Each member of the family got one head and ate it with the broth. No scallions or dill were added to the magiritsa.\nMy recipe for Easter soup was given to me by my cousin's wife, Katy Kremezi, whose mother came from Smyrna (Izmir) in Asia Minor.","hed":"Easter Lamb Soup","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:53.000Z","author":[{"name":"Aglaia Kremezi"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/easter-lamb-soup-231781","photoData":{"id":"560dd6d37b55306961bfa863","filename":"231781.jpg","caption":"Easter Lamb Soup","credit":"Martin Brigdale","promoTitle":"Easter Lamb Soup","title":"Easter Lamb Soup","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Greek","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["Head, neck, some intestines, and liver of a young lamb or 3 pounds lamb bones","2 large onions, halved","Sea salt","1/2 cup olive oil","2 cups finely chopped scallions","1 small chili pepper, minced, or freshly ground pepper to taste","1 1/2 cups chopped fresh dill","2 eggs","Juice of 1 1/2-2 lemons"],"prepSteps":["Wash the lamb head and neck thoroughly and place in a pot with the onions.

The ritual was as follows: Simontov, the guard at the front door downstairs, would appear carrying a bronze tray with Turkish coffee and the heavenly, flaky pastries filled with spinach or cheese, called filikas in Ladino. It is rare today to have such delicious burekas, in Jerusalem or anywhere else in Israel. Most of the dough is commercially produced puff pastry, much thicker and less flaky than the homemade phyllo used to be. A few places, like Burekas Penzo in Tel Aviv (near Levinsky Street), which has been making the pastries by hand in the Turkish style for more than thirty years, produce a close second to those I remember from my days in Jerusalem. Various Ladino names like bulemas and boyos differentiate fillings and distinguish a Jewish bureka from a Turkish one. If you can find the thick phyllo dough, that works well. Otherwise, try this.

Most homemakers buy it breaded and frozen and serve it preceded by hummus, tahina, and other salads for a quick main meal. As I went from table to table throughout Israel, I found the dish to be more or less the same, prepared with spice combinations that vary depending on the ethnic background of the cook. Yemenite Jews, for example, add garlic, cumin, turmeric, cardamom, and hawayij. Polish cooks often use matzoh meal. A classic schnitzel includes both butter and oil, which has been changed to just oil in Israel.

Nathan also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.\nTo read more about Nathan and Israeli cuisine, click here.\nAccording to the Ten Commandments, \"On the seventh day thou shalt rest,\" which means that no cooking can be done on the Sabbath. This tradition is the reason Israel is truly the center of the world for cholent, an overnight stew. Almost all Jewish families have brought their own unique versions — with Hungarian smoked goose breast, Brazilian black beans, Moroccan rice, Bukharan turkey giblets and raisin-stuffed cucumbers, or Polish barley and meat. A dish that has experienced a rebirth even among secular Israelis in the last few years, cholent is often served as a centerpiece main course for parties, usually blending several traditions in one exciting creation.\nEons ago, needing a dish that could be kept warm for the Sabbath, Jewish cooks came up with an overnight stew, the ingredients for which varied depending on where they lived. The stew was tightly sealed, often with a paste-like dough, and cooked before the Sabbath began, then left overnight in the embers to warm until the next day. During World War II, before Israelis had proper ovens, the cholent often was simmered over the small flame of a kerosene stove, the lid covered with two heavy bricks.\nThe word cholent comes from the French chaud, meaning \"warm,\" and lent, meaning \"slow.\" In Israel, it is also called hamim, Hebrew for \"warm.\" Like outdoor grilling, preparing cholent seems to have become the Israeli man's domain. It is served on every Israeli army base on Saturday, even in small military units on their own at lookout posts throughout the country, since the army, which officially observes the dietary laws, must serve a traditional Sabbath meal.\nThis Hebronite hamim recipe was given to me by Amnon Lipkin Shachak, a former Israeli army chief of staff. He combines the Ashkenazic basic beans and barley with Sephardic sausages and the long-cooking eggs in their shells called huevos haminadav to make an innovative Sabbath dish from Hebron, the city from which part of his family hails. According to him, the recipe changes each time he makes it, depending on what he can find in the cupboard. This version requires kishke (a traditional delicacy made of flour and fat stuffed into sausage casing, today obtainable from Jewish specialty stores) and the robust and highly aromatic eastern Mediterranean spice combination of baharat (see Tips, below).","hed":"Chief of Staff Cholent (Hebronite Hamim)","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:53.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Nathan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chief-of-staff-cholent-hebronite-hamim-231758","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.75,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups white or red kidney beans","1 1/2 cups chickpeas","2 large onions, chopped","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","1/2 cup light-brown sugar","1/4 cup water","4-pound beef brisket, with fat","1 cup long-grain rice","1 teaspoon salt","Freshly ground pepper to taste","1 cup parched wheat (frika), bulgur, or barley","4-5 beef soup bones","1 pound kishke","1 pound pearl onions","5 medium potatoes, peeled and halved","6 large eggs in the shell","2 tablespoons baharat, or to taste","4-5 teaspoons beef soup powder or 4 beef bouillon cubes"],"prepSteps":["1.
