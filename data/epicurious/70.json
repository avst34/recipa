Tip onto\na plate and leave to cool.","Meanwhile, grease an 8-inch straight-sided, loose-bottomed\nflan or cake tin (1-inch deep) and set it\non a baking tray.","Once the sesame seeds are cool, tip them and\nthe remaining pastry ingredients, along with\n3 tablespoons of water, into a food processor.\nWhiz together until they form damp crumbs.","Alternatively, to make by hand, put the flour and\nbutter into a large bowl. Pick up bits of the mixture\nwith the tips of your fingers and rub your thumb\ninto your fingers to blend the ingredients together,\nallowing it to fall back into the bowl. Keep doing this\nuntil the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir\nthe sesame seeds through. Lightly beat the egg in\na small bowl and stir into the crumbs really well\nwith a small knife until it starts to form lumps.","Add 3 tablespoons of water to bring it together.","Dust a clean work surface with a little flour and tip the\ndough out onto it. Bring it together into a smooth ball\nthen roll it out to the thickness of that of a\nnickel (about 2mm) to give a roughly 8 2/3-inch circle\n(slightly larger than the diameter of the tin).","Carefully lower the pastry into the prepared tin,\neasing it against the bottom and edges. Use a small,\nsharp knife to trim the excess pastry off the top rim,\nusing bits of the excess to seal up holes or cracks\nif necessary. Scrunch up a circular piece of baking\nparchment a little larger than the tin, then unscrunch\nand sit it in the pastry crust. Tip in ceramic baking\nbeans or dried beans and bake for 20 minutes.","Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the oil or butter\nin a medium pan over a low–medium heat. Add the\nonion and cook down for about 10 minutes or until\nsoft, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, beat the crème\nfraîche, yogurt, and eggs together in a large bowl until\ncombined. Stir in the kale, season, and set aside.","After the pastry has been cooking for 20 minutes,\nremove the paper and beans and return the pastry\ncrust to the oven for a further 5 minutes or until the\npastry is cooked, the base is sandy to the touch, and\nit looks lightly golden brown.","Once softened, remove the onion from the heat and\nleave to cool. Once cool, stir into the kale mix.","Once the pastry crust is cooked, remove from the\noven and pour in the kale mixture. Arrange the\nsmoked salmon on top. Bake for 35 minutes, or until\nthe salmon is catching colour and the quiche cooked\nthrough to the centre. Remove and allow to cool a\nlittle.
