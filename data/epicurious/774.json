It is made with a fermented batter containing soaked black gram bean paste and rice semolina (cream of rice). The batter is poured into the depressions in the idlee molds and steamed to yield porous, spongy cushions called idlee. The proportion of beans to rice is the most crucial element in making light and airy idlees: The rice is always twice the quantity of beans. The dumplings expand when they are steamed, and their nutritive value goes up with the fermentation of the batter; they become rich in proteins that are easily digestible.\nThese dumplings are traditionally served with coconut chutney and Red Gun Powder (see tips at bottom of Idlee Sambaar recipe). Children usually like to eat them with palm jaggery syrup, which is somewhat difficult to find here in the United States. However, unsulphured molasses, natural honey, and maple syrup make wonderful substitutes.\nThe best way to keep the dumplings warm is to put them in another steamer over hot (not boiling) water.

(Or if you don't, you should buy a sharpening stone, and you'll never have blunt knives again.) The idea for this recipe came about when we were catering a HUGE job on a TINY budget. They wanted tuna tartare, but I knew it would be expensive, and it's best eaten soon after it's made or it starts to get all gummy. Gravlax, on the other hand, needs at least a couple of days to cure, so I decided to use diced salmon instead of tuna, for economy, and to marinate it with our gravlax spice mix a day before the event, freeing up the chefs for other last-minute things. In my test run, I added orange zest, thinking, isn't orange good with salmon?\nNormally you would put something like this on a cucumber slice and that would be fine, but the juniper in the marinade suggested potato, so we served it on a slice of crisp potato, and it was ravishing in the extreme. The potatoes can be made ahead of time too, as long as they're cooked until they're completely crisp and stored in an airtight container until you need them. Any potato not cooked all the way through will soften the others; if that happens, pop them all in a 350°F oven for five minutes, or until they've crisped up again.\nThe salmon can be sticky, so use two teaspoons to put it on the potato. I could never remember of which there was more in the gravlax cure, sugar or salt (since in the basic gravlax recipe one is three tablespoons and one is four). So after years of irritably looking up such a short recipe, I decided to THINK for a second and realized salt has four letters so salt is the four tablespoons.

It's best to turn an entire 12-ounce jar of preserves into glaze, storing the glaze in the empty preserves jar, so you have small amounts ready when needed.","hed":"Apricot Glaze","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:52.000Z","author":[{"name":" Rick Rodgers"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/apricot-glaze-231044","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Eastern European/Russian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 1/4 cups apricot preserves","2 tablespoons golden rum or water"],"prepSteps":["Bring the preserves and rum to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often.

Heat a heavy sauté pan over high heat and add the onion halves, cut side down. Cook until they blacken on their cut sides, about 10 minutes.","2. Fill a stockpot halfway with water and set it over high heat. When the water boils, salt it well, then add the meat, onions, and 2 of the marrowbones. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Partially cover the pot and bring the water to a very low simmer; it should bubble only slightly for the duration of the cooking time. Simmer for 3 hours, checking on the meat periodically, turning it occasionally and adding a little more water if necessary to keep the meat covered.","3. Add the carrots, turnips, kohlrabi, celery root, juniper berries, allspice berries, pepper, and bay leaf. Simmer until the vegetables are cooked, 20 to 30 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the vegetables to a platter as they become tender. Continue to cook the meat until there is no resistance when it is pierced in its center with a long fork yet it still retains its shape, another 30 minutes.","4. Place the remaining 3 marrowbones, marrow sides up, in a saucepan. Cover with cold water, and add the thyme and garlic. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and let the bones poach until the marrow is translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Drain the bones. Slide a paring knife around the inside of the hole to gently push the marrow free, and cut the marrow into 1/2-inch slices. Reheat the marrow in a 250°F oven or at a low setting in a microwave just before serving.","5. Meanwhile, prepare the spinach puree: In a wide saucepan or sauté pan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Let it cook until the white milk solids fall to the bottom and turn nut-brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the shallots and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and cook, stirring, until the shallots soften, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 2 more minutes.","6. Add the cream and thyme to the pan and bring the liquid to a boil. Simmer until reduced by one third, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the vegetable stock and let the liquid return to a boil. Add the spinach and cook gently, stirring and tossing, until it is tender, about 2 minutes.","7. Remove the thyme. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spinach to a blender or food processor, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Puree the spinach, and season it with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and nutmeg to taste. If necessary, add some of the reserved cooking liquid so the puree is just loose enough to pour. Keep warm (or reheat gently before serving).","8. Prepare the apple-horseradish sauce: Peel the apples, reserving the peels and submerging the apples in a bowl of water acidulated with the lemon juice.","9. Place the apple peels in a small saucepan. Cover with 3/4 cup water and add the sugar, cinnamon stick, and clove. Bring to a boil and let simmer, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the peels steep in the liquid until cool.","10. Place the horseradish in a large bowl and grate the apples finely over it. Strain the apple-peel liquid, and pour 1/2 cup of the liquid over the grated apple. Toss to combine. and add more horseradish if desired. Set aside.","11. To prepare the chive mayonnaise, place the bread cubes in a bowl and cover with the milk. Let soak until soft, about 20 minutes.","12. Use your hands to squeeze the milk from the bread cubes, and place them in a blender with the egg yolks, 1/4 cup broth taken from the kavalierspitz, chopped cornichons, crème fraîche, and sour cream. Blend to combine. With the motor running, add a few drops of Champagne vinegar, then drizzle in a small amount of the canola oil in a very thin stream, processing until the oil is absorbed before adding a little more vinegar. Continue alternating vinegar and oil until you have used it all. The mixture should be of a thick but pourable consistency, and just slightly piquant. Season it to taste with salt and white pepper, and set it aside. Just before serving, stir in the hard-cooked egg and chives.","13. When the beef is tender, transfer it to a platter and cover it with plastic wrap. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer. If you're not going to serve it immediately, place the beef in a clean pot, cover with the strained broth, and surround with the baby vegetables. Heat gently just before serving.","14. To serve, slice the steak across the grain into 2-inch-wide pieces. Lay them in the center of each soup plate, and garnish with the baby vegetables. Ladle the cooking liquid on top of and around the meat. Garnish with a slice of bone marrow, and any or all of the garnishes (freshly grated horseradish, lovage, grated nutmeg, a sprinkle of fleur de sel, chopped chives). Serve with the spinach puree, apple horseradish sauce, and chive mayonnaise on the side.","• \"To elevate and refine this traditional dish, we paid close attention to every detail, using only the highest-quality ingredients and sophisticated techniques,\" says Lohninger. He prefers the Kavalierspitz, a tender cut from the shoulder, over the more common tafelspitz cut from the upper leg. \"This was Kaiser Franz Josef's favorite cut,\" says Lohninger. \"Because it has gelatin running through the middle, it stays very moist and juicy.\" Kavalierspitz is sold in the United States as Yankee steak or chicken steak, and you'll probably have to call ahead at a good butcher to get it. Beef cheeks or short ribs could also be substituted.","• \"The garnishes in this recipe are very authentic,\" says Lohninger. \"But if you're pressed for time, you can substitute unsweetened store bought applesauce mixed with a little horseradish for the applesauce recipe here, and sour cream mixed with chives for the white sauce. But in my opinion, you need the creamed spinach — or a cabbage dish — to really feel like you're having boiled beef.\".","• Purple-black, pea-sized juniper berries are the flavoring in gin, so you'll recognize their piney-sweet flavor. In Austrian cooking they are added to everything from cabbage to meat. They're generally available in the spice section of better supermarkets. Look for berries that are still somewhat soft rather than hard and shriveled.","• Kohlrabi are bulbous, green vegetables, sometimes tinged with purple, that are popular in Austrian cooking for their crisp, nutty, white flesh, similar to a mild turnip. Lovage is a celerylike vegetable. A mix of parsley and celery leaves can be substituted for the lovage leaves."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"54a42c826529d92b2c010abe","dek":"(Poori)\nEditor's note: These instructions are excerpted from Julie Sahni's book Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking.

Combine chapati flour and all-purpose flour (or whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour) with salt in a bowl. Rub 2 tablespoons of oil into it. Add water, fast at first, to moisten the flour so it adheres into a mass; then slowly, little by little, until the dough is formed and can be kneaded.","2. Place the dough on the work surface, brush your fingers and knuckles with the remaining teaspoon of oil (this will prevent the dough from sticking to your hand), and knead for 10 minutes or until you have a soft and pliable dough that is smooth and silky in appearance. Note from Epicurious: According to Sahni, the dough can be mixed and kneaded in a food processor without a sacrifice in quality. For instructions, see the Tips, below.","3. Cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap or a moist towel, and let it rest for 1/2 hour. (The dough may be made a day ahead and refrigerated, tightly covered. Remove from refrigerator about 30 minutes before you are ready to roll.)","4. Put the flour for dusting in a plate, and keep it close to the work surface where the dough is to be rolled.","5. Knead the dough again for a minute, and divide into 2 equal portions. With your hands, roll each portion into a rope, and cut each rope into 8 equal portions or pinch off small pieces of dough and roll them into 1-inch balls). Roll the small pieces into smooth balls, dust them lightly with flour to prevent their sticking to each other, and put them back into the bowl. Keep the balls covered loosely with a damp towel or a sheet of plastic wrap to prevent their drying out.","6. Working one at a time, place a ball, generously dusted with flour, on the work surface, and roll it into a 5-inch circle, pressing and stretching it with the rolling pin. Dust the dough from time to time to keep it from sticking to the work surface or rolling pin. (All the breads may be rolled ahead of time and kept covered with a sheet of plastic wrap or a moist towel until you are ready to fry them.)","7. While the last few breads are being rolled, start heating the oil in a kadhai, chicken fryer, or a deep saucepan that can be used as a fryer. When the oil is very hot and begins to smoke (400°F), drop one bread at a time into the oil. The bread will sink to the bottom. Immediately hold a slotted spoon flat over the bread, as though keeping it from rising, but not quite touching the bread. As the bread begins to sizzle and rise to the surface (about 3-5 seconds), press the bread very gently, as though patting it, for 2-3 seconds. This will puff the bread. Once the bread begins to puff up, be careful not to press the puffed part too hard, or the bread will break and oil will seep in. Let the bread cook until it stops sizzling and the underside is slightly brown. The entire process of puffing and cooking the first side should take about 15 seconds. Gently flip the bread, and let the other side cook about 15 seconds. Take it out, and drain it briefly on kitchen towels. Repeat with the rest of the rolled bread the same way. Serve immediately; or deflate them by placing them on the work surface and pressing gently, and put them in a covered dish or wrap in foil. Just before serving, warm them in a 300°F preheated oven for 15-20 minutes.","Poori can be served with practically all vegetarian main dishes, all side dishes, and those meat and chicken dishes that have reddish-brown sauces. Poori is traditionally served with Tari Aloo (potatoes in fragrant gravy) in Aloo-Poori, or with Keema Matar (ground beef and chickpeas in cashew nut sauce) in Keema-Poori, a combination generally served for Sunday brunch. You can also serve these combinations at picnics and barbecue parties for an unusual yet delicious flavor. For such occasions, make the pooris ahead, deflate, and wrap them lightly in foil. Just before serving, place them, still wrapped in foil, near the charcoal grill or barbecue pit to heat them slightly."],"reviewsCount":4,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a42c1c19925f464b380011","dek":"(Idlee Sambaar)\nEditor's note: These instructions are excerpted from Julie Sahni's book Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking.
