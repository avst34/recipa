Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves; bring just to simmer (coffee will foam and rise to top edge of pan). Divide half of coffee among 6 small cups, pouring slowly to avoid breaking foam on top. Return pan to low heat and let mixture foam again to top edge of pan. Carefully pour remaining coffee into cups, leaving grounds in saucepan. Serve immediately."],"reviewsCount":2,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a42ea319925f464b38205c","dek":"Editor's note: The recipe below is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by executive chef Mary Nearn of Miraval Life in Balance Spa.","hed":"Chocolate Cherry Biscotti","pubDate":"2007-04-05T15:24:39.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mary Nearn"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chocolate-cherry-biscotti-238304","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Mixer","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.33,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened","3/4 cup Demerara sugar*","2 large eggs","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour","1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder","2 teaspoons baking powder","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","3/4 cup dried tart cherries","*Demerara sugar, which is raw cane sugar, is available at natural food stores or online at igourmet.com."],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 350°F.
