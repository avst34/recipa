Today most vegetables are consumed as salsas, in soups, or stuffed into quesadillas and empanadas, but there's no reason why a vegetable taco shouldn't be every bit as tasty and unusual as any other. This sumptuous vegetarian feast is based on the classic combination of roasted poblano chiles and mushrooms, with the addition of corn and mild-flavored, soft queso fresco. This taco is often favored by even the most committed carnivores. In other seasons, bits of diced cooked sweet potato, zucchini, chayote, squash blossoms, or golden winter squash would be welcome additions.\nFresh epazote, used as a flavoring in this taco, has a minty-oregano taste and is often available at Mexican markets. (It is also hardy and easy to grow.)

You can minimize this by choosing smaller, fresh-looking sprouts and cooking them just until they are crunchy-tender and bright colored. (Do not use frozen sprouts.) The secret of this dish is balancing ingredients to mellow the strong flavor of these miniature cabbages. Olive oil, garlic, red pepper, Parmesan, and, especially, nutmeg do the trick admirably.","hed":"Brussels Sprouts for People Who Think They Hate Brussels Sprouts","pubDate":"2010-04-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andrew Weil, M.D."},{"name":" Rosie Daley"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/brussels-sprouts-for-people-who-think-they-hate-brussels-sprouts-358275","photoData":{"id":"56098ecbe0acd286555d375d","filename":"358275.jpg","caption":"Brussels Sprouts for People Who Think They Hate Brussels Sprouts","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Brussels Sprouts for People Who Think They Hate Brussels Sprouts","title":"Brussels Sprouts for People Who Think They Hate Brussels Sprouts","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Cheese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.44,"ingredients":["1 pound Brussels sprouts","1 teaspoon salt","2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil","1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes, or to taste","5 cloves garlic, finely minced","1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, or to taste, preferably freshly grated","1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese"],"prepSteps":["Trim the ends off the Brussels sprouts and remove and discard any discolored outer leaves.

Usually, you dredge them in flour, cornmeal, or bread crumbs before adding them to the hot pan, and it's something that most everyone seems to like. But you can take that crunch and give it an intense flavor by dredging the scallops directly in a spice mix. Although you can't do this with everything—dried herbs don't get crisp, and some spices are far too strong to use in this quantity—it works perfectly with curry powder, which not only seasons the scallops and their accompanying sauce but gives them the crunch we all crave.","hed":"Curried Scallops with Tomatoes","pubDate":"2010-04-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Mark Bittman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/curried-scallops-with-tomatoes-358318","photoData":{"id":"56098ed862fa7a9917c1d8a2","filename":"358318.jpg","caption":"Curried Scallops with Tomatoes","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Curried Scallops with Tomatoes","title":"Curried Scallops with Tomatoes","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Pepper","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.89,"ingredients":["3 medium ripe tomatoes","1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil","1 1/2 to 2 pounds large sea scallops","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","2 tablespoons curry powder, or to taste","1/2 cup heavy cream, sour cream, or yogurt, optional","Juice of 1 lime","1/2 cup washed, dried, and chopped fresh cilantro"],"prepSteps":["1.Core the tomatoes (cut a cone-shaped wedge out of the stem end), then cut them in half horizontally.

This recipe came from my Great-Aunt Molly, who always used fresh coconut milk in her cake. If I'm feeling unusually energetic, I do the same (see Tip). Otherwise, I substitute coconut cream, which is a lot easier to manage. My cousin Vera Mitchell Garlough used to make this cake with her mother and sister. Vera wrote: \"Mama used the standard boiled frosting from her Searchlight Cookbook, 1931 printing. The method called for boiling sugar and water until it made a thread when dripped from a spoon, then adding the very hot syrup very slowly to stiffly beaten egg whites, beating all the time. Then, we did not have the luxury of an electric mixer in our home so sister Barbara and I, while young girls, learned to make this frosting as a team. She poured while I beat, then she beat while I poured—using an old wire whisk. Somehow, it became stiff and always turned out right and we never scalded ourselves with the hot syrup. In later years, when she bought a double boiler, Mama used this standard recipe, which I use today.\"","hed":"Christmas Coconut Cake","pubDate":"2010-04-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rebecca Rather"},{"name":" Alison Oresman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/christmas-coconut-cake-358291","photoData":{"id":"56098ed16a59cdb91b5f780e","filename":"358291.jpg","caption":"Christmas Coconut Cake","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Christmas Coconut Cake","title":"Christmas Coconut Cake","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.5,"ingredients":["1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature","2 cups sugar","3 cups all-purpose flour","4 teaspoons baking powder","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","1/4 cup whole milk","1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk (available canned in the Asian section of most grocery stores, or see Tip)","1/4 cup coconut cream (Coco Lopez)","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","8 large egg whites at room temperature","1 cup cold heavy whipping cream","2 tablespoons coconut cream (Coco Lopez)","1/2 cup grated fresh coconut (optional, see Tip)","2 large egg whites","1 1/2 cups sugar","1/3 cup cold water","1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar","1/4 teaspoon kosher salt","1/2 cup mini marshmallows","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","3 to 4 cups unsweetened flaked coconut for decorating"],"prepSteps":["Place an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and another in the top third of the oven.

Stand the coconut up over a small bowl or glass measuring cup to catch the milk as it drains out. Next, crack the hard outer shell with a hammer, then pry off the pieces.
