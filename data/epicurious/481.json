This recipe, which includes Neely's Barbecue Seasoning and eleven other ingredients, became one of the keys to our success as restauranteurs. Now it can be the base of your own kitchen success.\nMemphis Barbecue sauce is known for its sweet and tangy tomato base. Ours keeps true to that tradition, striking a perfect balance between the sweet (we use brown and white sugar), the tangy (cider vinegar), and the tomato base (good ole ketchup!). Any self respecting Memphis pit master will tell you that the sauce must complement the meat without overpowering it, and ours does just that.\nAt the restaurant we simmer the sauce for five hours, and we always taste the blend before cooking it, making sure we've got all the ingredients working. Over the years, we've learned that if it tastes good before it cooks, it's gonna be outstanding after a long, slow simmer. The end result: an insanely thick, rich, and sweet sauce, and the perfect adornment for any rack anywhere.","hed":"Neely's Barbecue Sauce","pubDate":"2009-05-18T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Pat Neely "},{"name":" Gina Neely"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/neelys-barbecue-sauce-353569","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Sauce","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.47,"ingredients":["2 cups ketchup","1 cup water","1/4 cup light-brown sugar","1/4 cup granulated sugar","1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper","1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder","1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder","2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice","2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce","1/2 cup apple-cider vinegar","2 tablespoons light corn syrup","1 tablespoon Neely's Barbecue Seasoning"],"prepSteps":["Combine all of the ingredients in a large pot or a Dutch oven.
