Brick morphed so naturally from the good earth—add water and high heat (ecco fatto, terracotta) and civilization started to build in a big way. Roman bricks were longer and narrower than present-day bricks, but any brick will do. If you have a few handy, you should wash them, let them air-dry, and wrap them in a few sheets of aluminum foil.

He recommends serving this salsa with his Carnitas or Carne Adobada Tacos .\nThe Spanish name for this salsa means \"rooster's beak,\" and originally referred to a salad of jicama, peanuts, oranges, and onions. But today, whether you're in Minneapolis or Mexico City, if you ask for pico de gallo, you'll get the familiar cilantro-flecked combination of chopped tomato, onion, and fresh chiles. This tart, crisp condiment (also known as salsa Mexicana) has become so common on Mexican tables that it seems like no coincidence that its colors match those of the national flag. Besides finding firm ripe tomatoes and seeding them, the key to this salsa is adding plenty of lime juice and salt, and not skimping on the chiles. Because without a burst of acidity and heat, you're just eating chopped tomatoes.","hed":"Pico de Gallo: Fresh Tomato Salsa","pubDate":"2011-02-24T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Roberto Santibañez"},{"name":"JJ Goode"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pico-de-gallo-fresh-tomato-salsa-364429","photoData":{"id":"54b2f8c83edeef84363b59a0","filename":"364429_pico-de-gallo-salsa_1x1.jpg","caption":"Pico de Gallo: Fresh Tomato Salsa ","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Pico de Gallo: Fresh Tomato Salsa ","title":"Pico de Gallo: Fresh Tomato Salsa ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["3/4 pound tomatoes (about 2 medium), seeded and finely diced (1 1/2 cups)","1/3 cup chopped cilantro","1/4 cup finely chopped white onion","1 small fresh jalapeño or serrano chile, finely chopped, including seeds, or more to taste","1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice, or more to taste","1/2 teaspoon fine salt, or 1 teaspoon kosher salt"],"prepSteps":["Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl.

Spiedino—;literally \"little spit\"—refers to food cooked on skewers, which is how we like to prepare pork loin.
