to legend, in the early 1700s, a Milanese bishop made a surprise visit to the town of Saronno in Lombardy.

The bishop so loved the cookies that he blessed the couple, and the recipe became a local favorite.\nToday, bakeries throughout the region, and in Italian communities around the world, carry amaretti di Saronno, but it's worth the (small) effort to make them yourself.

The salad is light because the tuna is dressed with olive oil and fresh lemon juice instead of the usual mayonnaise. The fresh herbs give it brightness, and the red bell peppers and purple olives make for a colorful and appetizing preparation. The important thing here is to use the tasty tuna packed in olive oil enjoyed throughout the Mediterranean region, rather than the drier, rather mealy white tuna packed in water.","hed":"Tuscan Tuna Salad with Fennel","pubDate":"2006-11-16T18:04:04.000Z","author":[{"name":"Aliza Green"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tuscan-tuna-salad-with-fennel-236731","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.76,"ingredients":["3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 cup fresh lemon juice","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste","","2 tablespoons chopped tarragon (or 2 teaspoons dried)","1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley","2 (6-ounce) cans tuna in olive oil, drained","1 small head fennel, chopped","2 ribs celery, chopped","1/2 of a small red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)","1 pound mixed greens (romaine, butter lettuce, radicchio, and arugula) or spring mix","Tuna Salad","1 red or orange bell pepper, cut into matchsticks","1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives"],"prepSteps":["Using a whisk or an immersion blender, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, tarragon, and parsley.
