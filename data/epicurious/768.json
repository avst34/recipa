Among her repertoire were light, slightly tangy cheese dumplings. No one, however, ever wrangled the real recipe from her. Fortunately, I found a number of cooperative cooks who were more than willing to share their recipes with me.\nThese popular dumplings are called topfenknodel in Austria and Germany, turos gomboc in Hungary, syrove knedliky in Czech, and kluski in Poland. Topfen, also called quark in German, is a thick, slightly tangy central European curd cheese popular for making dumplings, spreads, and toppings. Since topfen is generally unavailable in America, a little cream cheese is added to the pot cheese to approximate the original texture and flavor. You can substitute farmer cheese for the pot cheese, but first wrap it in several layers of paper towels, then let it drain for about 10 minutes to extract some of the excess moisture. Do not use cottage cheese, which contains too much liquid and is too firm. My grandmother served savory cheese dumplings on Shavuot as an appetizer, accompanied with sour cream or browned bread crumbs (2 cups fresh bread crumbs sautéed in 6 tablespoons butter until golden), or a sweetened version as dessert.","hed":"Central European Cheese Dumplings","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:54.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gil Marks"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/central-european-cheese-dumplings-233357","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Eastern European/Russian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.5,"ingredients":["1 3/4 cups (14 ounces) pot or soft goat cheese","1/4 cup (2 ounces) cream cheese or mascarpone, softened","1/4 cup grated onion","1 teaspoon table salt or 2 teaspoons kosher salt","2 large eggs, lightly beaten","2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened","About 3/4 cup semolina flour, farina (not quick-cooking), or matza meal"],"prepSteps":["1.

In a large stockpot, bring 6 quarts water to a boil. Place the bones and beef chuck in a second pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and boil vigorously for 5 minutes. Using tongs, carefully transfer the bones and beef to the first pot of boiling water. Discard the water in which the meat cooked.

The amounts of salt, oil, and saffron water remain the same.","•Batmanglij highly recommends using a rice cooker for this recipe — it's easier, and the nonstick, evenly heating surface ensures a good crust. She favors the National Deluxe brand — if you're using a different brand, check the instructions, as you may need to change the measurements and cooking times. •Though many Iranians now use vegetable oil, clarified butter (ghee) is Iran's traditional cooking fat. To make it, start with a third more unsalted butter than you will need for the recipe. Melt the butter over low heat, then increase the heat to medium low and simmer the butter, without stirring, until it stops crackling and the milk solids brown and drop to the bottom. Skim off any foam from the top, and strain the ghee through a colander lined with cheesecloth.

Martinez also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.\nTo read more about Martinez and Oaxacan cuisine, click here.\nMole Verde, or just Verde for short, is the lightest and freshest-tasting of Oaxaca's \"seven moles.\" Of the many variants I've tried, this version served with pork loin at the Oaxaca City restaurant Casa de la Abuela is my favorite.\nFresh herb rather than spice accents are what distinguish a Mole Verde. A purée of green herbs has to be added at the last minute. In other parts of Mexico I've had green moles made with various greens, even lettuce leaves. But the Oaxacan Mole Verde uses just three: epazote, hoja santa, and parsley. If you can't get the first two you'll have to improvise with what's available, but the results will not be at all Oaxacan. Dried epazote and hoja santa are better than none at all, though the fresh herbs are incomparable. The amount of chiles can be varied to taste; however, this particular sauce is not usually very picante (hot).\nAt Casa de la Abuela they combine the sauce with white beans that have been cooked separately, to keep the flavors simple and distinct. It is very important not to overcook the pork loin, a tender cut that dries out easily. I have devised a way of using boned pork loin that gets some added flavor from the reserved bones. When you have the meat boned, ask the butcher to tie the meat to the backbone and ribs. At serving time, untie and carve it to distribute both meat and rib pieces equally. If this is not practical and you have to get preboned loin without the frame of bones, buy 1 pound of pork neck bones separately and cook them with the meat. It will add some body and flavor.\nMole Verde is also delicious made with chicken instead of pork. In that case, use a 3 1/2-pound chicken, cut into serving pieces, and simmer as directed below for the pork loin, reducing the cooking time to 30 minutes. Remove the skin before serving.","hed":"Green Mole with Pork","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:54.000Z","author":[{"name":"Zarela Martinez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/green-mole-with-pork-232062","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["2 pounds boneless center cut pork loin in one piece, rolled and tied together with the ribs and backbone","1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, bruised","1 teaspoon salt, or to taste","9 garlic cloves","8 whole cloves, or 1/4 teaspoon ground","","1 teaspoon cumin seeds","3 jalapeño chiles, tops removed","6 large tomatillos, husks removed","1 small onion, cut into chunks","2 sprigs fresh thyme","2 sprigs fresh marjoram","1 cup (8 ounces) masa, either fresh or reconstituted by mixing 6 tablespoons masa harina to a smooth paste with 1 cup of water (see Tips, below)","1 medium bunch Italian parsley","Eight 6-inch sprigs fresh epazote or 1/4 cup dried, crumbled (see Tips, below)","","3 large or 5 medium-size fresh hoja santa leaves or 6 dried leaves (see Tips, below)","","2 cups cooked Great Northern or other white beans"],"prepSteps":["Choose a deep saucepan or Dutch oven large enough to hold the meat comfortably.

Until well into the twentieth century, most Europeans ate only cooked carrots, primarily in stews and soups. In the Middle East, people also used them as a component of cooked dishes, but sometimes added grated or minced raw carrots as a minor ingredient to various salads. It was in northwestern Africa that carrots, both cooked and raw, became the featured component of salads — typically an accompaniment to couscous or part of an assortment of salads.\nMoroccans brought carrot salads to Israel in the 1940s, and they quickly became ubiquitous. These salads are a traditional Rosh Hashanah dish in Israel, a symbol of a sweet and fruitful year to come. At many Israeli restaurants, cooked carrot salad automatically appears on the table with the bread, pickles, and hummus. The carrots are usually flavored with charmoula, a characteristic Moroccan marinade of oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and salt. Most cooks add heat with chilies, sometimes in dangerous proportions. I have tasted some that left me gasping and other that proved a lively appetizer, so adjust the amount of chilies to your own preference and that of your guests. For fancy presentation, Israelis serve raw carrot salad, commonly called gezer chai (\"live carrots\"), in quartered avocados or on a bed of lettuce leaves, garnished with a sprig of mint.","hed":"Moroccan Raw Carrot Salad","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:54.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gil Marks"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/moroccan-raw-carrot-salad-231922","photoData":{"id":"579f8d28c9298e5449591821","filename":"moroccan-raw-carrot-salad.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"moroccan-raw-carrot-salad.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Moroccan","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.3,"ingredients":["1 pound carrots, coarsely grated (about 4 cups)","1/4 cup vegetable oil or extra-virgin olive oil","3 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice","1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley","2 to 4 cloves garlic, mashed or minced","1 teaspoon ground cumin or 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1 teaspoon sweet paprika","Pinch of salt","About 1/2 teaspoon harissa (Northwest African chili paste), 1 tablespoon minced green chilies, or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne (optional)"],"prepSteps":["In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients.
