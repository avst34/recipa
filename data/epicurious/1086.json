All that's missing from this Halloween scene is something sweet—for the kids, of course.\nHow about caramel apples? You could make them, and then the kids could help with the decorating. That would be a great way to introduce them to one of your childhood favorites. After all, you’re much too mature these days to take a big, sticky bite out of a succulently sweet caramel apple, but the kids will devour them. And at least they’ll be eating apples — even if they are coated with delicious caramel, and even if they are decorated with chocolate and nuts and sprinkles.\nOur resident candy expert and senior food editor, Sarah Tenaglia, developed an easy recipe for the caramel, and she outlined straightforward steps to follow while making it. She also came up with all sorts of decorating ideas.\nPerfect. Now you have everything you need for Halloween — for the kids, of course.\nMaking the caramel requires the use of a clip-on candy thermometer, which should be tested for accuracy before starting. Attach it to the side of a medium saucepan of water, and boil the water for three minutes. The thermometer should register 212°F; if it doesn’t, take the difference into account when reading the temperature.","hed":"Caramel-Dipped Apples","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/caramel-dipped-apples-102427","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.78,"ingredients":["1 1-pound box dark brown sugar","16 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature","1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk","2/3 cup dark corn syrup","1/3 cup pure maple syrup","1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract","1 teaspoon robust-flavored (dark) molasses","1/4 teaspoon salt","12 chopsticks","12 medium Granny Smith apples","Assorted decorations (such as chopped nuts, dried apricots and dried cranberries, toffee bits, mini M&M's and candy sprinkles)","Melted dark, milk and/or white chocolates","Whipping cream (if necessary)"],"prepSteps":["Combine first 8 ingredients in heavy 2 1/2-quart saucepan (about 3 inches deep).
