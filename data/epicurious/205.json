Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Take the brisket out of the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking, to bring it to room temperature. After 30 minutes, season the meat with 2 tablespoons salt.","Preheat the oven to 325°F.","Heat a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the olive oil, and wait for 1 minute. Place the brisket in the pan (reserving the garlic and chiles). Sear the meat on both sides, about 8 minutes per side, until it's deep golden brown. You will need to sear a portion of the meat at a time, because the entire brisket probably won't fit in the pan. To do this, leave one end of the brisket hanging off the edge of the pan, and then move that end into the pan when the other part is well seared. Once both sides are well browned, transfer the brisket to a large roasting pan that has a tight-fitting lid, or a Dutch oven.","Return the brisket searing pan to the stove over medium-high heat, and add the onion, carrot, and celery. Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the crusty bits in the pan.

Since I was taught the recipe by a pair of Calabrian sisters, I make mine as their Mamma makes hers; and this takes the wreath form.\nI'll be honest: you don't make these because you're seeking some exquisite taste sensation; struffoli are about custom, celebration, and sweetness. This, in effect, is the festive centerpiece of Christmas in the south of Italy.\nYou get a very real sense of this if you make the struffoli not alone, but in company, with other hands to roll out the dough with you. Children love doing this, by the way, and their little hands are much better suited for rolling the small marble-sized dough balls you need. Obviously, children are best kept away from the deep-frying part of the operation.\nAs for the decoration, I've seen not only the regular cake-decorating sprinkles used but also candied fruit, glacé cherries, almond dragées, and cinnamon-preserved pumpkin pieces. It's the former, solely, for me. And although I've seen only the multicolored ones in Italy, I go for the festive and flag-resonant Christmas sprinkles in red, white, and green. The struffoli would look more beautiful, perhaps, left burnished but otherwise unadorned, although gaudiness not elegant restraint—I'm firmly told—is in order here; I have tried to maintain some balance between the two.","hed":"Struffoli","pubDate":"2013-10-31T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nigella Lawson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/struffoli-51203810","photoData":{"id":"54ad4b0c19925f464b3b403f","filename":"51203810_struffoli_1x1.jpg","caption":"Struffoli","credit":"Petrina Tinslay","promoTitle":"Struffoli","title":"Struffoli","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons semolina","6 eggs","1 tablespoon sugar","zest 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated","2 tablespoons olive oil","3–3 1/3 cups flour, plus more for rolling","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","2 1/2–3 quarts flavorless vegetable oil, for frying","1 1/2 cups honey","approx. 2 teaspoons Christmas sprinkles, to decorate"],"prepSteps":["Get out a large, rimmed baking sheet and shake the semolina over the base. And get out another tray (it doesn't have to be a baking sheet) and line it with a double layer of paper towels. Set both aside while you get on with the dough.","Beat the eggs, sugar, finely grated lemon zest, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil until frothy. Gradually add about 2 2/3 cups of the flour and the baking powder, and mix to a dough. If it is too sticky, then add more flour and keep kneading, using either your hands or a freestanding mixer fitted with a dough hook, until you have a smooth, pliable dough. This doesn't take very long: probably around 3 minutes or 5 by hand.","Flour your work surface and turn out your dough. Then divide the dough into 10 roughly equal pieces, each about the size of a golf ball. Take 1 ball and roll it into a rope approx. 1/2 inch thick, then with floury hands divide this into about 20 small pieces, and roll each piece between your hands (flouring them again if this helps) to make marble-sized balls.","Place the formed balls of dough on the semolina-sprinkled baking sheet, as you shape them. Repeat the process with the remaining golf-ball-sized portions of dough: you should make a staggering 200 of the tiny balls!","Heat the vegetable oil in a wide, heavy pan—about 11 inches diameter and at least 6 inches deep—and then when the oil is at 375°F but no higher (you can leave a preserving or candy thermometer in, if you want), or a piece of bread sizzles and browns immediately when dropped in the pan, you can begin to cook the dough balls. Regulate the temperature and keep a careful eye on the pan and the oil all the time.","Gently lower, using a mesh scoop or perforated spoon, about 15 little dough balls at a time. At first they will sink and then, as they cook, they'll float to the surface and begin to turn golden brown. This will take up to about 1 minute depending on how many you have in at a time, but be ready to fish them out with your mesh scoop or perforated spoon onto the paper towel–lined tray as soon as they become the right golden color. And keep watching your pan.","Continue to cook them in batches—making sure the oil returns to the correct temperature but doesn't get too hot or bubble too vigorously—until they are all fried; you can pile them up on the tray without harm. Now turn off the heat under the oil pan, and move on to the adhesive and assembly stage.","Pour the honey into a roasting pan that can go on the stove, and heat very gently until it becomes runny—a matter of moments, so do not leave the pan—then take it off the heat.","Tip all of the fried dough balls into the warmed honey and, using a soft spatula, turn them gently to coat them. Get out a large plate or cake stand with a slight lip or rim and, with wet hands, check the balls are not too hot then pick up the sticky balls and arrange them around the outer edge of the plate in the shape of a bobbly wreath, leaving just a small empty circle in the middle. Do not worry about symmetry or perfection or counting dough balls here, please.","Wash the honey from your hands and shake your chosen sprinkles over the sticky wreath, then stand back and admire, before placing your creation where others can do likewise. These struffoli are best, to my mind, eaten on the day they're made. Use a scoop or spoon and fork to serve.

Actually, though, American-Italian food has had its own influence on the cooking of the Old Country: these days, I am reliably informed by my Italian publisher and celebrated food writer, Csaba dalla Zorza, you can find dried cranberries with relative ease in Italy.\nThe true Italian Christmas dinner is very much about the capon. Yes, you can find capons outside of Italy, although not everyone can quite cope with the idea of eating a castrated cockerel. Many understandably view old-school caponization with distaste, although it is considered ethically acceptable if the rooster has been chemically rather than surgically castrated. I don't know about you, but the idea of eating meat that has been flooded with the types of hormones necessarily involved here gives me the willies.\nBesides, my Christmas Dinner is my Christmas Dinner: unchanging, ritualistic, an intrinsic part of me. When in Rome, and all that, but if I'm cooking at home, I don't fiddle with my time-honored menu. I'm not going to give an evangelical tub-thump about my turkey brining techniques, as I've done enough of that in the past, but I am still open to other ways of celebrating the Big Bird and this recipe is a case in point. For me, it is perfect for any sort of seasonal supper party, but really comes into its own on a buffet table, as it carves fantastically and is as good (maybe even better) cold than hot, so you can make it in advance and then be the world's most unharried host on the night.\nYou need to go to a butcher to get a while breast joint and you need to ask for it to be butterflied and boned and make sure the skin is left on.\nI know it might sound a bit of a faff, but take it from me that stuffing a while double breast joint is very much easier than stuffing and rolling a single breast joint, as is more commonly found in supermarkets. Basically, all you're doing here is opening out your boneless turkey joint, smothering it with stuffing, and folding it over. What you end up with, for all the ease of its creation, is nothing short of a showstopper.","hed":"Turkey Breast Stuffed with Italian Sausage and Marsala-Steeped Cranberries","pubDate":"2013-10-31T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nigella Lawson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/turkey-breast-stuffed-with-italian-sausage-and-marsala-steeped-cranberries-51204010","photoData":{"id":"54ad48dc6529d92b2c043211","filename":"51204010_turkey-breast-stuffed_1x1.jpg","caption":"Turkey Breast Stuffed with Italian Sausage and Marsala-Steeped Cranberries","credit":"Petrina Tinslay","promoTitle":"Turkey Breast Stuffed with Italian Sausage and Marsala-Steeped Cranberries","title":"Turkey Breast Stuffed with Italian Sausage and Marsala-Steeped Cranberries","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Poultry","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1,"ingredients":["2/3 cup dried cranberries","7 tablespoons Marsala","2 tablespoons olive oil","2 echalion or banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped","1/4 teaspoon ground cloves","1/2 teaspoon ground allspice","2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage","2 1/4 pounds Italian sausages","2 eggs, beaten","approx. 1/2 cup grated Parmesan","approx. 1 cup bread crumbs","1 X 11-pound boneless (double) turkey breast, butterflied, with skin left on","1/4 cup duck or goose fat"],"prepSteps":["Put the cranberries and Marsala into a small saucepan and bring to a boil, then take off the heat and leave to one side.","Put the oil into a large frying pan or similar heavy pan, and fry the shallots for a minute or so, then add the spices and chopped sage, turning them in the soft shallots.","Squeeze the sausage meat out of its skins, add to the pan, and break it up—using a wooden fork and spatula for ease—turning it in the hot pan until it loses its pinkness.

Thread 2 skewers through the base—i.e., the widest part that is nearer you—to keep it closed, and smear it all over with the duck or goose fat.","Roast the turkey breast for 2–2 1/2 hours, then check it is cooked with a turkey or meat thermometer. When cooked, it should read 165°F in the center.
