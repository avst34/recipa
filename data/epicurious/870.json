Transfer the marinade to a bowl and stir in the remaining yogurt.)","2. Divide the chicken pieces between two 1-gallon self-sealing plastic bags. Pour in the marinade and seal the bags. Refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 8 hours.","3. Position two racks in the top third and center of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Line two large baking sheets with aluminum foil and lightly oil the foil. (This makes for easy cleanup.)","4. Remove the chicken from the marinade. Arrange on the baking sheets. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken and switch the positions of the baking sheets from top to bottom. Continue baking until a drumstick shows no sign of pink when pierced at the bone, about 25 minutes more. Transfer to a serving dish. Serve the chicken hot."],"reviewsCount":14,"willMakeAgainPct":67},{"id":"54a4395819925f464b389114","dek":"Editor's note: The recipe below is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by Canyon Ranch.","hed":"Veal Demi-Glacé","pubDate":"2005-02-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/veal-demi-glace-234085","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.4,"ingredients":["3 pounds assorted veal bones","3/4 pound veal leg bone","1/2 carrot, roughly chopped","1 small onion, roughly chopped","1 celery stalk, roughly chopped","1 bouquet garni (see Chef's notes, below)","Canola oil in kitchen-oil spritzer (See Chef's notes, below)","1/4 cup finely chopped shallots (about 1)","2 garlic cloves, finely chopped","1/4 cup red Burgundy wine","2 tablespoons dry sherry","1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper","1/4 teaspoon salt","1 tablespoon cornstarch"],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 350°F.
