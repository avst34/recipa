My father ate it when his family had little to eat, and still to this day he enjoys it with a bottle of soju (sweet potato vodka). My mother told me that the aroma of the dish was so good that it would entice her neighborhood girlfriends to peek over the walls that divided the homes and ask, \"Hey, can I come eat that with you?\" And because the girls enjoyed the company as much as the food, they sat by the fire cooking up one pancake at a time, talking and eating until their mothers called them back home.","hed":"Seafood Pancake","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jenny Kwak "},{"name":" Liz Fried"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/seafood-pancake-109591","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.6,"ingredients":["7 ounces fresh squid (calamari)","18 ounces fresh shrimp","2 ounces oysters","2 cups flour","1 1/2 cups water","2 eggs","2 teaspoons crushed garlic","1/2 teaspoon salt","5 ounces scallions, chopped into 1-inch pieces","2 teaspoons vegetable oil","2 teaspoons soy sauce","2 tablespoons vinegar","1 teaspoon sugar","1 teaspoon red pepper flakes","2 teaspoons sesame seeds"],"prepSteps":["1.
