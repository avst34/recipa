Process for about 8 seconds, or mix, until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the egg and water and pulse 6 to 8 times, or mix briskly, until the dough forms a smooth ball. Remove from the bowl and kneed for a few minutes between the palms of your hands. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.","Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, then grease well with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.","Place the pumpkin chunks skin side down on the sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bake for about 1 1/2 hours, until the flesh of the pumpkin is very soft when pierced with the tip of a knife or fork.

Transfer to the bowl with the pumpkin, then add the rice, eggs, half the Parmesan, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper. Mix with a wooden spoon, slowly adding the remaining Parmesan, until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside.","Using a pasta machine (ideally), roll out the dough to a 1/16 inch thickness. Or, on a floured surface, roll out the dough with a floured rolling pin into a rectangle approximately 13 by 22 inches and a 1/16 inch thick.

Then, filling in the bottom half of the rectangle, spoon 20 walnut-sizes mounds of filling evenly spaced over the dough, 1 1/2 inches apart. If you are working with a narrower, machine rolled dough rectangle, you’ll need to make ten rows of two. If you’re working with 13 by 22 inch dough rectangle, make four rows of five mounds.","Moisten the dough slightly around each mound, then carefully lift carefully lift the top half of the dough with a spatula and fold it over the bottom half, making sure the edges for the dough meet on all sizes. Gently press the dough together around each mound of filling with your fingertips. Cut the individual purses apart, then press with the tines of the fork to seal. A slightly easier method of forming the purses — practical if you are not adept at working with the dough — is to cut the rolled-out dough into 20 individual rectangles approximately 4 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches.
