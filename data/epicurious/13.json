The glaze will be a little runny at first, perfect for drizzling on pound cakes and Bundt-type cakes. If you want slightly thicker coverage, such as on a cheesecake or sheet cake, you can let the glaze cool slightly before spreading it. If the sauce cools and starts to thicken and you need to rewarm it to thin it out, heat it very gently in a saucepan.
