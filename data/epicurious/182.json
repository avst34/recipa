It draws on the flavors of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, but the truth is, I created it to encourage my son to eat eggplant. He always loved fried zucchini sticks, so I cut eggplant in the same shape and he was none the wiser (although here they're cut in rounds). This is a good example of how I have taken advantage of ingredients that are available to me in the States and married them with the classic preparations from my childhood.","hed":"Eggplant Napoleon","pubDate":"2014-03-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rawia Bishara"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/eggplant-napoleon-51231820","photoData":{"id":"555a0f89644d45515b7546ae","filename":"51231820_eggplant-napoleon_1x1.jpg","caption":"Eggplant Napoleon","credit":"Peter Cassidy","promoTitle":"Eggplant Napoleon","title":"Eggplant Napoleon","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Middle Eastern","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1,"ingredients":["3 medium eggplants (2 1/2 to 3 pounds total), stem and root ends trimmed and discarded, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds","Sea salt for sprinkling","1/4 cup Basil Pesto","1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil","6 cloves garlic, finely chopped","Juice of 3 lemons","1/2 cup all-purpose flour","2 egg whites, beaten","2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)","2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese","2 tablespoons dried parsley","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","Corn oil for frying","3 cups Mutabal","8 plum tomatoes, chopped","1 medium red onion, chopped","7 tablespoons Basil Pesto","Juice of 2 lemons","3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil","Pinch sea salt"],"prepSteps":["Arrange the eggplant slices on two sheet pans, sprinkle with salt, and set aside for 30 minutes or until they begin to sweat.

But when I arrived in America, I experimented with various ingredients and found myself adding tomatoes, chile pepper and a hint of cumin to my mutabal. I serve it with grilled meat and chicken. My children love this preparation, which is also great spread on toasted or fresh Arabic bread, crusty flatbread or crackers.","hed":"Mutabal","pubDate":"2014-03-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rawia Bishara"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/mutabal-51231810","photoData":{"id":"54ac97ed19925f464b3ac7ea","filename":"51231810_mutabal_1x1.jpg","caption":"Mutabal","credit":"Peter Cassidy","promoTitle":"Mutabal","title":"Mutabal","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Middle Eastern","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["3 medium eggplants, 2 1/2 to 3 pounds total","4 plum tomatoes or 2 Jersey tomatoes, finely chopped","2 chile peppers, seeded and finely chopped, optional","4 to 5 cloves garlic, minced","1 shallot, minced","1 cup chopped fresh parsley","6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or to taste","Juice of 2 lemons, plus more for finishing","1/2 teaspoon ground cumin or to taste","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","Sea salt to taste","Sliced cucumbers for garnish"],"prepSteps":["Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for grilling over high heat, or turn 3 gas burners to high.
