It is a great bar serving delicious seafood and their salad was my favorite—red wine vinaigrette with big hunks of blue cheese. We were always a blue cheese—loving family and my version, with a creamy base (can't compete with Gus!), is fantastic on a wedge of iceberg lettuce or as a dip. It lasts for a good week in the fridge as well.","hed":"Blue Cheese Dressing","pubDate":"2011-04-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gwyneth Paltrow"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/blue-cheese-dressing-364989","photoData":{"id":"56043a36968c2fa94dc989f4","filename":"364989.jpg","caption":"Blue Cheese Dressing","credit":"Courtesy of Grand Central Publishing","promoTitle":"Blue Cheese Dressing","title":"Blue Cheese Dressing","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"occasion","name":"Picnic","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1/3 cup sour cream","1/3 cup Vegenaise","1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese (use the picante or mountain kind, not the dulce)","1/3 cup cold water","1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar","1 large shallot, peeled and thinly sliced","Big pinch coarse salt","A few fresh grinds black pepper"],"prepSteps":["Stir everything together in a small bowl."],"reviewsCount":1,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"54a424126529d92b2c00a280","dek":"Again, easy peasy.

And once you've made it, you'll know why. It serves up the kind of home-cooked goodness that no restaurant meal can top. The chicken's crispy skin is drenched in herb-infused juices (don't forget to pour the pan dripping back over the chicken before serving or, alternately, to drizzle them over individual pieces on the plate), and the trick of turning the chicken 15 minutes into cooking keeps the meat uniquely moist.\nAny simple sides will work with a main course this splendid. You can go with either white wine (in which case a Riesling would be nice) or red (try pinot noir). Happy cooking-and an even happier future to you and the lucky person you've deemed worthy of this dish.","hed":"Engagement Chicken","pubDate":"2011-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Cindi Leive"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/engagement-chicken-364889","photoData":{"id":"54b2e5b13edeef84363b35c8","filename":"364889_engagement-chicken_1x1.jpg","caption":"Engagement Chicken","credit":"Jonny Valiant","promoTitle":"Engagement Chicken","title":"Engagement Chicken","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.76,"ingredients":["1 whole chicken (approx. 4 pounds)","1/2 cup fresh lemon juice, plus 3 whole lemons ­including 1 sliced for garnish","1 tablespoon kosher or coarse sea salt","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper","Fresh herbs for garnish (4 rosemary sprigs, 4 sage sprigs, 8 thyme sprigs, and 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley)"],"prepSteps":["Position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F.
