Reduce the heat to moderate, add the flour all at once, and with a wooden spoon beat the mixture until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball. Remove the pan from the heat, add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and stir in the Stilton, the bacon, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter 2 inches apart onto lightly buttered baking sheets and bake the puffs in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are crisp and golden."],"reviewsCount":32,"willMakeAgainPct":91}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:50:30.222Z","count":1944,"number":1000,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1001&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=999&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
