When they did not go out to fish, they made arroz de piedras with mollusks from the rocks (piedras means rocks). The fishermen went around local villages selling their fish on scooters, and people inland added vegetables. In Catalonia, where the tradition of mixing meat and seafood is very old, they had pieces of chicken, pork, rabbit, or duck and sausage in their seafood paellas. Today adding meat and vegetables to seafood paella has become common in other regions, where seasonal vegetables such as green beans, peas, artichokes, or peppers also go in.

I have eaten almond cakes in other parts of Spain, but this one is special. Pilgrims and tourists who visit the great Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, where the relics of the apostle Saint James are believed to be buried, see the cake in the windows of every pastry shop and restaurant. It is usually marked with the shape of the cross of the Order of Santiago. I have watched the cake being made in many sizes, big and small, thin and thick, over a pastry tart base at a bakery called Capri in Pontevedra. This deliciously moist and fragrant homey version is without a base. There is sometimes a little cinnamon added, but I find that masks the delicate flavor of orange and almonds and prefer it without it.\nWhen I suggested to a man associated with the tourist office in Galicia that the tarta was a Jewish Passover cake, I was dragged to a television studio to tell it to all. The hosts thought the idea made sense. The Galician city of Coruña is on the Jewish tourist route, because of its synagogue and old Jewish quarter. Jews from Andalusia, who fled from the Berber Almohads' attempts to convert them in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries came to Galicia, where they planted grapevines and made wine.\nThe cake is normally made in a wide cake or tart pan and so comes out low, but it is equally good as a thicker cake.","hed":"Almond Cake","pubDate":"2011-06-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Claudia Roden"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/almond-cake-366229","photoData":{"id":"54b2adec11c5d6af478b1d8f","filename":"366229_almond-cake_1x1.jpg","caption":"Almond Cake ","credit":"Jason Lowe","promoTitle":"Almond Cake ","title":"Almond Cake ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Spanish/Portuguese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.83,"ingredients":["1/2 pound (1 3/4 cups) blanched whole almonds","6 large eggs, separated","1 1/4 cups superfine sugar","Grated zest of 1 orange","Grated zest of 1 lemon","4 drops almond extract","Confectioners' sugar for dusting"],"prepSteps":["Finely grind the almonds in a food processor.","With an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar to a smooth pale cream.
