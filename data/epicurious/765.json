It's said to have originated centuries ago when King Hung Vuong VI challenged his many sons that whoever came up with the best recipe for Tet would inherit his throne.\nThe eldest one, eager to impress his father, traveled far and wide to procure the most exotic recipes. But the youngest son, the shy and quiet one, stayed close to home and cooked a dish based on a dream. A genie had told him to take sticky rice (which symbolized earth), wrap it around a ball of mung bean paste (which represented the sun), then boil it for one day and one night. Upon tasting the dish and hearing the story, the king was so impressed he proclaimed his youngest son the heir to his throne and ordered the recipe to be shared with all commoners.\nSince that day, banh chung has enjoyed a central place in Vietnamese culture — at the family table and on the ancestor worship altar. Since it's considered taboo to work or cook during the first three days of Tet, these cakes are usually made before the festivities begin. Serve this dish at room temperature with a side of salt and pepper or reheat slightly in the microwave and serve as part of a meal.","hed":"Vietnamese Rice Cakes in Banana Leaves","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mai Pham"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/vietnamese-rice-cakes-in-banana-leaves-233845","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Vietnamese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 3/4 cups sticky (glutinous) rice, preferably long-grain","1 drop of green food coloring (optional)","1/4 cup dried split mung beans","1/4 teaspoon salt","2 tablespoons chopped shallots","1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce","1 teaspoon ground black pepper","5 ounces pork shoulder or butt, cut into 1/4-inch-thick chunks","1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil","2 (14\" x 16\") sheets plastic wrap plus extra","1 (14\" x 16\") sheet aluminum foil","2 (14\" x 14\") pieces banana leaf"],"prepSteps":["1. Place the sticky rice in a large bowl and cover it with 3 inches of water. Stir in the food coloring, if using, and let the rice soak overnight. (Once soaked, the rice will double to about 4 cups.) In a separate bowl, soak the mung beans for at least 4 hours. Drain both just before using and set aside in separate bowls. Add the salt to the rice and stir to blend.","2.

Cover with the remaining mung beans and place 1 cup of rice on top. Bring the narrow sides of the wrappers together. Fold the gathered edges over twice, then flatten against the packet. (You now have two open ends.) Fold one end over and hold the packet upright. Add half of the remaining rice, tapping it and pushing it down so the packet will be an even square. Fold the end over and repeat on the other side.","6. Place the packet with the folded sides down in the center of the remaining plastic sheet. Wrap tightly so that water will not seep into the packet during cooking.","7. Tightly tie the packet with two parallel strings in both directions (as in a tic-tac-toe pattern).","8. Fill a large stockpot with water. Add the packet and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Place a colander or something heavy on top of the packet to keep it submerged in the water.

The following summer when I catered Billy's birthday, I made the sandwiches as an appetizer and served them with a cream of tomato dip — an idea that my friend Sergio Gomez gave me. When Emeril Lagasse made pimento cheese on his show, he told the audience that when you're in the South as a guest in someone's home, and they bring out the pimento cheese it's a special thing, so I was really honored when Billy made this dish for me.\nNote: Any leftover dip, can be thinned out a bit with more soymilk and served as soup. When I cater parties I place the dip in small shot glasses or demitasse cups, and slice the sandwiches into long strips and serve them on top of the glasses. I also like to slice a small baguette thinly and use that to make the sandwiches.","hed":"Pimento Cheese Bites with Cream of Tomato Dip","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Akasha Richmond"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pimento-cheese-bites-with-cream-of-tomato-dip-234197","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 cup diced onion","1 large shallot, minced","1 teaspoon kosher salt","1 can (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes in juice, chopped (retain juice)","1 tablespoon tomato paste","1 cup vegetable broth","1 bay leaf","1/4 cup chopped fresh basil","1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon fresh","2 tablespoons white rice flour","1 cup plain soymilk","1/4 cup soymilk creamer","1 teaspoon sugar, optional","Freshly ground black pepper to taste","1 cup grated soy or dairy cheddar cheese","2 tablespoons vegan or light mayonnaise","2 tablespoons chopped green onion","1/4 cup diced pimentos, drained","1 tablespoon chopped green olives","1/8 teaspoon kosher salt","1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","1/4 teaspoon hot red pepper sauce","6 slices spelt, whole-wheat, or sliced sourdough bread","Canola cooking spray, olive oil, or 1 tablespoon unsalted butter"],"prepSteps":["To make the dip, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a 4-quart soup pot.

Chase also shared some helpful tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.\nI remember going to Mardi Gras parades and seeing fried chicken being sold on the street. There really wasn't any Mardi Gras in Madisonville — everybody left for New Orleans in hay trucks. Sometimes I could go, but usually my father wouldn't let us miss school.\nWe would go to see the Zulu parade, which was on Claiborne Avenue from Canal Street to St. Bernard Avenue. Claiborne was lined with beautiful oaks then. Some of the people held open houses on Claiborne, for their friends. The street was full of booths, with blacks selling fried chicken, fried fish, and red beans. My favorite thing about Mardi Gras was that we could eat in the street. My father never even let us eat candy outside normally.\nI also thought it was so fun to dress in costume. But a lot of Creole ladies used the occasion to bring out their first spring suit. They would wear violet corsages, and walk with canes with a celluloid feathered doll on top. I thought it was a shame to get all fancy on Mardi Gras, instead of playing like the other maskers.\nThe Zulu parade mocked the white parades. The \"African King\" would wear a huge crystal doorknob as a ring. They were very funny. They wandered all over, passing households that paid them to go that way. Now Mardi Gras is so big that organized routes need to be followed. That's good to impose some kind of order where so many people are involved.\nOne group put on a Mardi Gras Breakfast Dance that was very fancy. The invited guests — usually teachers and professionals — would go in hats and gloves. I got invited eventually and wasn't so impressed. I was just happy to be watching the parade, finally able to eat some fried chicken in the street.","hed":"Southern Fried Chicken","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Leah Chase"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/southern-fried-chicken-233899","photoData":{"id":"57a8a45db10b4fb03f234f34","filename":"southern-fried-chicken.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"southern-fried-chicken.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.61,"ingredients":["1 3-lb. fryer","1 tbsp. salt","1 tbsp. black pepper","2 eggs (beaten)","1/2 cup Pet milk","1/2 cup water","2 cups flour","1 tsp. paprika","1/4 tsp. ground thyme","1/2 tsp. granulated garlic","1 qt. oil for frying"],"prepSteps":["Cut chicken in eight pieces.

I always love serving this to friends who think tofu dishes are bland.","hed":"Spicy Lemongrass Tofu","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mai Pham"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/spicy-lemongrass-tofu-233844","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Vietnamese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.38,"ingredients":["2 lemongrass stalks, outer layers peeled, bottom white part thinly sliced and finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)","1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce","2 teaspoons chopped Thai bird chilies or another fresh chili","1/2 teaspoon dried chili flakes","1 teaspoon ground turmeric","2 teaspoons sugar","1/2 teaspoon salt","12 ounces tofu, drained, patted dry and cut into 3/4-inch cubes","4 tablespoons vegetable oil","1/2 yellow onion, cut into 1/8-inch slices","2 shallots, thinly sliced","1 teaspoon minced garlic","4 tablespoons chopped roasted peanuts","10 la lot, or pepper leaves, shredded, or 2/3 cup loosely packed Asian basil leaves"],"prepSteps":["1.

You can make this with chicken stock, but the coconut milk adds body and enhances the overall flavor. Depending on my mood and the time of year, I sometimes serve this with a warmed baguette (a French influence) instead of steamed rice. Other times, I just make the curry with more broth and serve it with rice noodles. Like other curries, it's delicious the next day.","hed":"Chicken Curry with Sweet Potatoes","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mai Pham"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chicken-curry-with-sweet-potatoes-233843","photoData":{"id":"57ab6c8525175b383477359e","filename":"chicken-curry-with-sweet-potatoes.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"chicken-curry-with-sweet-potatoes.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Vietnamese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.81,"ingredients":["3 tablespoons curry powder, preferably Three Golden Bells brand","1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste","2 pounds skinless chicken thighs","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","1 tablespoon chopped shallot","2 teaspoons minced garlic","2 teaspoons ground chili paste or dried chili flakes, or to taste","3 tablespoons fish sauce","1 tablespoon sugar","2 lemongrass stalks, cut into 3-inch pieces and bruised with the flat side of a knife","1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled, cut into 3 slices and bruised with the flat side of a knife","1 1/2 cups fresh chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth","3 carrots, peeled, cut on the diagonal into 2/3-inch pieces","1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut milk or cow's milk","1 yellow onion, cut into wedges","1 medium sweet potato (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes","1/2 cup Asian basil leaves, cut in half","8 sprigs cilantro, cut into 2-inch pieces","2 scallions, chopped"],"prepSteps":["1.
