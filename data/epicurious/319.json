Parents, children, mothers-in-law, grandparents, and other family members often all live together for generations, taking care of one another. Jiaozi, or classic Chinese dumplings, is a dish that celebrates this supportive community. Often made at holidays, these labor-intensive dumplings are prepared in an assembly line, with the greatest to the least in the family all having a hand in their production.\nThe process starts when wheat dough is kneaded, rolled flat into teacup-size circles, and stacked as dumpling wrappers. The next person in the line spoons a pork or vegetable filling (depending on the recipe) in the center of each wrap before passing them on to the \"crimper.\" My first experience making jiaozi was at the house of one of my professors, Mr. Zhang. Having been invited to dinner, I was surprised when Mr. Zhang put me to work in the kitchen. I was the \"crimper,\" charged with folding and crimping the edge of the dumpling wrappers to form plump, sealed pockets of goodness ready to be thrown into a boiling pot. That night, in the room full of brothers, sisters, cousins, and grandparents who were not my own, all of us working together to make jiaozi, I felt more like family than simply a guest in the Zhang home. Invite your friends and family over and put them to work. We like to make more dumplings than we can eat and freeze the extra for later.\nIf you throw all the freshly made dumplings into a plastic bag, they will freeze stuck together into one giant block of dumplings. To avoid this, first spread out the uncooked dumplings on a lightly greased baking sheet, taking care that they do not touch each other. Place the sheet in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Then throw all the dumplings into a large resealable plastic bag and store in the freezer. When you are ready to eat them, do not defrost the dumplings, but cook them frozen exactly like you would fresh dumplings—just add 3 minutes to the cooking time.","hed":"Jiaozi Dumplings","pubDate":"2011-12-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mary Kate Tate "},{"name":" Nate Tate"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/jiaozi-dumplings-369489","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Chinese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["2 1/2 cups minced napa cabbage","1/2 teaspoon salt","11 ounces ground pork","2 tablespoons light soy sauce","2 teaspoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry","2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil","1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger","1/2 cup minced green onions, green and white parts","1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","About 60 round Dumpling Wrappers (purchased premade, or see sub-recipe )","Chinese black rice vinegar, for dipping"],"prepSteps":["To make the filling, toss the cabbage and salt together in a large bowl and let sit for 15 minutes.

Years ago, Gwen and I were on our way home from a road trip to the Canadian Maritimes when we were forced off the highway by some epic construction. We ended up on a wandering road that took us through a charming series of dying industrial towns. There was not much to see... and definitely nothing to eat. But then, in Fall River, Massachusetts, right at the border of Rhode Island, we stumbled across culinary gold: an old gas station converted into a root beer stand. The owner, a retired A&W root beer guy, was behind the counter; all he served was root beer in frosted glasses. Our root beer came with a long lecture about chilling the glass, not the root beer itself (that kills the taste). We sat at a broken-down old picnic table and sipped. I'm all about root beer, and that roadside glassful was the best I ever tasted. This recipe is my stab at bringing that taste to cake—because the only thing better than root beer is root beer plus cake.\nThere's a mad-scientist component to this recipe: when you whisk the baking soda into the molasses and root beer, there's going to be some crazy bubbling up going on, straight out of sci-fi. Don't worry: it's completely normal.","hed":"Root Beer Cake","pubDate":"2011-12-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andrew Carmellini"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/root-beer-cake-369449","photoData":{"id":"54b27879a801766f773f5d22","filename":"369449_root-beer-cake_1x1.jpg","caption":"Root Beer Cake","credit":"Quentin Bacon","promoTitle":"Root Beer Cake","title":"Root Beer Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, for the pan","1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour","One 12-ounce bottle (1 1/4 cups) root beer","1/2 cup molasses","1/2 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon baking soda","3/4 cup dark brown sugar","1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil","3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar","One 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated on a microplane or on the finest side of a box grater (1 teaspoon)","2 teaspoons vanilla extract","1 large egg","1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder","1 1/4 teaspoons ground star anise","1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom","1/2 whole nutmeg, grated (or 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg)","Finely grated zest of 2 lemons","1 teaspoon kosher salt","1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper","3/4 cup heavy cream","1 tablespoon sassafras bark (or 1/2 teaspoon sassafras extract; see Note))","2 cups powdered sugar","Pinch of ground star anise","Pinch of ground cardamom","1/4 teaspoon kosher salt","1/4 whole nutmeg, grated (or about 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg)","Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350°F.","Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-inch cake pan well with some of the butter.","Cut out a piece of parchment paper so it fits closely into the bottom of the cake pan. Line the bottom of the pan with the parchment, and then grease the parchment with more butter.","Shake 1 tablespoon of the flour into the cake pan, and shake it around so it sticks to the butter. Tap out any excess flour that doesn't stick to the parchment or to the sides of the pan.","Pour the root beer and molasses into a deep medium-sized pot, and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. (You need those high sides because the baking soda will froth up very high, and you don't want it to spill over! So make sure there's some meaningful space between the liquid and the top of the pot.)","Pull the pot off the heat and whisk in all the baking soda, so it froths up. Then put the pot right in the fridge to cool down a little.","While the root beer mix is cooling down, whisk the brown sugar, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, ginger, and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. The mixture will be a little chunky at this point.","Crack the egg into the bowl and whisk well. The egg is what makes everything come together smoothly: you should have a thick paste. Set this aside.","In another mixing bowl, combine rest of the flour with the baking powder, star anise, and cardamom. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and add the salt and pepper. Whisk everything together so it's well combined.","Take the root beer mixture out of the fridge. Pour a third of the flour mixture into a large mixing bowl; pour in one-third of the root beer mixture, then one-third of the sugar paste. Whisk everything together slowly (so it doesn't splash everywhere), and then add another one-third of the flour, another one-third of the root beer, and so forth, until everything is combined in the bowl. (The mix doesn't need to be completely and smoothly combined until the last of the wet and dry mixtures are in the bowl.) You should have a very wet, almost liquid batter.","Pour the batter into the cake pan, put the pan on a cookie sheet (to catch drips and splashes), and put it on the middle oven rack.","Bake the cake for 45 minutes without opening the oven at all (this cake will sink if you shake it up while it's baking). Check it: the cake should be high and dark brown, with a little bit of spring-back when you touch it (but not too much—it's a very moist cake). If it's not quite ready, rotate the pan and put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes before checking it again. The whole baking process shouldn't take longer than 55 minutes, even in a slow oven.","Whisk the cream and sassafras together in a small pot, and bring it up to a boil over medium-high heat.","As soon as it boils, pull the mixture off the heat, pour it into a glass or ceramic container (something that won't crack from the heat), and put it in the fridge. Let the mixture cool for about 30 minutes while the sassafras steeps into the cream, so you have a nice root beer flavor.","In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, star anise, cardamon, and salt. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and whisk everything together.","Strain the cooled cream through a fine-mesh strainer into a small mixing bowl (so the sassafras pieces don't end up in the glaze).","Gently whisk 1/2 cup of the cream into the powdered sugar mixture, holding back the last 2 tablespoons to see if you need it. If the mixture is dry and not coming together as a glaze, add more cream. Whisk the mixture well, until you have a shiny, thick liquid.","When the cake is ready, pull it out of the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes.","Flip the cake out of the pan onto a serving plate.","Spread the glaze thickly on top of the warm cake with a spoon. The glaze will melt and drip down the sides as you slather it on.","You can serve the cake as soon as it's cooled to room temperature—but like all spice cakes, it's even better the day after you make it.

Her name was Princess Doria, and every night, she would phone down to the kitchen and tell us what she wanted to eat for dinner. In the beginning, Gray would cook for her himself: he was Swiss, she was Swiss, it was a whole Swiss thing going on. But after a while, he got tired of taking her calls, and the job devolved to me and the sous chefs. Every night, that phone would ring, and I would say, \"Good evening, Princess,\" and she would tell me what she wanted to eat that night. Princess Doria wasn't into super-fancy creative cooking: her thing was refined-but-homey. Some- times, for example, it would be a roast pintade for two: I would plate the breast for her, and the thighs for her cat. So I developed some dishes that were just for her. I named them after her: Salad Doria, Chicken Doria. And sometimes on cold winter nights, she would call down and say, \"Andrew, I would like some Soup Doria tonight, please.\"\nTime passed. I left Lespinasse to travel and cook in France. When I got back to New York, I helped open Le Cirque 2000 in the Palace Hotel. We'd been up and running about two weeks when the kitchen phone rang by my station one night, right in the middle of the busiest part of service. I heard a familiar voice say, in French-accented tones, \"Andrew?\" Princess Doria on the line. She'd moved on to the Palace right behind me, and she would be pleased, she said, if I would send up some Soup Doria for her.\nThis soup is just Princess Doria's style. It's really a potage—a French minestrone, a chunky winter vegetable soup. I like to sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and serve it with some crusty, crunchy French bread.","hed":"Soup Doria","pubDate":"2011-12-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andrew Carmellini"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/soup-doria-369349","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","10 slices bacon, diced large (2 cups)","1 large sweet onion, quartered and sliced (about 2 cups)","2 large leeks, cut in half, cleaned, and roughly chopped (about 2 cups)","1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes","6 medium carrots, peeled and sliced (about 2 cups)","1 large celery root, peeled, cut lengthwise into 6 pieces, and sliced thin (about 2 cups)","2 2/3 pounds mixed potatoes (red, yellow, wax), washed but not peeled and sliced thin (about 2 cups)","10 Jerusalem artichokes, peeled or scrubbed and sliced into thin rounds (about 2 cups)","1 teaspoon salt","1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper","8 cups low-sodium chicken broth","Herb packet: 3 dried bay leaves and 10 fresh thyme sprigs, tied together with string","","1 bunch kale, washed, stemmed, and torn (about 6 cups)","Hazelnut or pumpkin-seed oil for drizzling","2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese"],"prepSteps":["Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.","Add the bacon and let it render slowly in the olive oil, stirring every so often to keep it from sticking, for about 5 minutes, until it starts crisping up.","Add the onions, leeks, and red pepper flakes.
