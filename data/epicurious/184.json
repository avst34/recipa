When you scrunch up your face with confusion, the person will then kindly explain that the correct term for this savory pastry is klobasnek. But wait, let's back up here for a minute. If you're not familiar with a kolache, then you may be wondering what the heck I'm talking about. Allow me to explain.\nA kolache is a sweetened yeast roll that's been stuffed with a fruit, cream cheese, or a poppy seed filling. The roll is either square or round, and there's a well in the center to contain the filling. With a klobasnek, the dough is wrapped entirely around the filling, and the only way you can tell what's inside is to take that first bite. You find these pastries all over Texas, though they were first introduced in Central Texan Czech communities, such as the small towns of West and Caldwell.\nWhile the origin of the term klobasnek for the sausage-stuffed version is a little vague, The Village Bakery in downtown West has claimed provenance for the term. What's interesting, however, is that these Czech pastries are more associated with Southeast Texas than with Central Texas.\nThe two pastries are different things, but some people still insist on calling them sausage kolaches. This doesn't bother me, but I can see how it could upset some linguistic purists. No matter what you call them, however, they are good. I like to eat them for breakfast, warm from the oven when the cheese is still melted and the sausage juicy with a snap. Though they are still good a few hours later at room temperature and can easily be reheated, too.","hed":"Klobasnek (Sausage Kolaches)","pubDate":"2014-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lisa Fain"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/klobasnek-em-sausage-kolaches-em-51230810","photoData":{"id":"56033a2dc301a9f945ef83ac","filename":"51230810.jpg","caption":"Klobasnek (Sausage Kolaches)","credit":"Lisa Fain","promoTitle":"Klobasnek (Sausage Kolaches)","title":"Klobasnek (Sausage Kolaches)","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Cheese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.33,"ingredients":["1 cup whole milk","8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter","1 tablespoon (1 packet) active dry yeast","1/4 cup sugar","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","2 egg yolks","1/2 cup (2 ounces) grated cheddar cheese","2 whole pickled jalapeños, cut into 16 slices (optional)","1 pound smoked kielbasa sausage, cut into 8 (2-inch) pieces"],"prepSteps":["Over medium heat, warm the milk and 4 tablespoons of the butter until the milk is just beginning to steam, but is not boiling, and the butter is melted.

It's now expanded to a much larger location, but in the 1970s it was in an old adobe building that had ten tables and to reach the dining room, you had to walk through the kitchen. Dallas went crazy for its soulful cooking, and the waits to get in were often long, but it was worth it.\nWe all had our favorite things to order: for my dad, it was the enchiladas, I loved the tamales, and my mom always went for the crazy nachos. Now, it always surprised me that my mom would order nachos since she ate them at home almost every single day for her lunch. However, she explained that while hers were good, Herrera's Crazy Nachos were the best.\nIn those days—before nachos became a sloppy stack of \"chips and stuff\"—nachos were a refined, simpler dish, with each individual tortilla chip topped with just cheese, beans, and jalapeños. So when Herrera's added taco meat, guacamole, and sour cream to their crazy nachos, it was considered quite daring and wild. That said, Herrera's crazy nachos were still elegant: each chip was a self-contained bite of all these fantastic flavors.\nI admit that the name may seem a bit dated to some, as there's really nothing crazy about these nachos at all. But no matter what you call them, they're a fully loaded treat that is great to enjoy when watching games or sitting around and visiting with family and friends.
