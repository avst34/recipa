The longer the roux cooks, the darker and more flavorful it—and the finished dish—will become. This recipe calls for cooking the roux for about 15 minutes, but for an even stronger flavor, it can be cooked for up to 30 minutes over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning.\nFilé powder, an iconic ingredient in Cajun and Creole cooking, is made from ground sassafras leaves. It's available in the baking aisle of some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores. It should be added to each individual portion just before serving, or the gumbo will become stringy.","hed":"Shrimp and Andouille Gumbo","pubDate":"2009-01-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bruce Mattel"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/shrimp-and-andouille-gumbo-351450","photoData":{"id":"5609a4ede0acd286555db6e6","filename":"351450.jpg","caption":"Shrimp and Andouille Gumbo ","credit":"CIA/Keith Ferris","promoTitle":"Shrimp and Andouille Gumbo ","title":"Shrimp and Andouille Gumbo ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Cajun/Creole","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.05,"ingredients":["1/2 cup vegetable oil","1/2 cup all-purpose flour","1 small cup onion, minced (about 1/2 cup)","1 small green bell pepper, minced (about 1/2 cup)","2 stalks celery, minced (about 1/2 cup)","1 quart chicken stock or low-sodium broth","2 bay leaves","1/2 pound shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cut into 1/2-inch dice","1/4 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds","1/2 pound fresh okra, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper","1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","4 cups cooked white rice","Hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco","About 2 teaspoons filé powder"],"prepSteps":["In 4-quart heavy stock pot over moderately high heat, heat oil.
