So, he opened his rig (a smoker-grill that is large enough for several whole hogs) and set his beer down on the cooking grate to get something small to cook from his cooler. He picked up a chicken and put it on top of his half-full can of beer without noticing what he was doing.

(Not that any self-respecting Texas barbecue buff would use a fork.) Barbecued brisket is simultaneously one of the easiest and most challenging recipes in the world of barbecue. Easy because it requires only one main ingredient: brisket (even the rub is optional). Challenging because pit masters spend years learning the right combination of smoke (lots), heat (low), and time (measured in half days rather than hours) to transform one of the toughest, most ornery parts of the steer into tender, meaty perfection.\nOver the years, I've found that two things help above all: choosing the right cut of -brisket—namely, untrimmed, with a thick sheath of fat—and then cooking the brisket in a shallow pan. The pan keeps the juices from dripping onto the fire and the meat from drying out, while allowing for the maximum smoke penetration from the top. A whole brisket (the sort cooked by a restaurant) weighs eighteen to twenty pounds. Here I call for a partially trimmed brisket—a cut weighing five to six pounds. Do not attempt to make this with a two-pound trimmed, fatless brisket; it will turn out much too dry.\nTo achieve the requisite smoke flavor, you need to smoke the brisket in a charcoal grill—or in a smoker. A gas grill will not produce enough smoke.","hed":"Texas-Style Barbecued Brisket","pubDate":"2008-04-14T04:12:37.000Z","author":[{"name":"Steven Raichlen"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/texas-style-barbecued-brisket-242249","photoData":{"id":"57479e07d058cce045e11d9b","filename":"shutterstock_286882427.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"shutterstock_286882427.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"occasion","name":"Graduation","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.71,"ingredients":["Indirect grilling","4 to 8 hours for curing the meat (optional); also, allow yourself about 6 hours cooking time","6 cups hickory or mesquite chips or chunks, soaked for 1 hour in cold water to cover and drained","1 beef brisket (5 to 6 pounds), with a layer of fat at least 1/4 inch thick, preferably 1/2 inch thick","1 tablespoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)","1 tablespoon chili powder","2 teaspoons sugar","1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","1 teaspoon ground cumin"],"prepSteps":["1.

Consider ribs. The pork rib is one of the most perfect morsels ever to occupy a grill. The meat is generously marbled, which keeps it moist during prolonged cooking. As the fat melts, it crisps the meat fibers and bastes the meat naturally. The bones impart a rich meaty flavor (meat next to the bone always tastes best), while literally providing a physical support—a gnawable rack on which to cook the meat. Yet depending on whether you eat ribs in Birmingham or Kansas City, or Bangkok or Paris for that matter, you'll get a completely different preparation.\nI've always been partial to Memphis-style ribs. Memphians don't mess around with a lot of sugary sauces. Instead, they favor dry rubs—full-flavored mixtures of paprika, black pepper, and cayenne, with just a touch of brown sugar for sweetness. The rub is massaged into the meat the night before grilling, and additional rub is sprinkled on the ribs at the end of cooking. This double application of spices creates incredible character and depth of flavor, while at the same time preserving the natural taste of the pork. Sometimes a vinegar and mustard based sauce—aptly called a mop sauce—is swabbed over the ribs (with said mop) during cooking; I've included one here, for you to use if you like.\nYou can choose any type of rib for this recipe: baby back ribs, long ends, short ends, rib tips—you name it. Cooking times are approximate. The ribs are done when the ends of the bones protrude and the meat is tender enough to pull apart with your fingers. I like my ribs served dry, in the style of Memphis's legendary barbecue haunt, the Rendezvous. If you want to serve them with a sauce, you'll find a number to choose from in this chapter.","hed":"Memphis-Style Ribs","pubDate":"2008-04-14T04:09:53.000Z","author":[{"name":"Steven Raichlen"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/memphis-style-ribs-242248","photoData":{"id":"560d7859f3a00aeb2f1cb524","filename":"242248.jpg","caption":"Memphis-Style Ribs","credit":"Greg Schneider","promoTitle":"Memphis-Style Ribs","title":"Memphis-Style Ribs","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.63,"ingredients":["Indirect grilling","4 to 8 hours for marinating the ribs","1 1/2 cups wood chips or chunks (preferably hickory), soaked for 1 hour in cold water to cover and drained","3 racks baby back pork ribs (about 7 pounds), or 2 racks pork spareribs (6 to 8 pounds total)","1/4 cup sweet paprika","4 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper","4 1/2 teaspoons dark brown sugar","1 tablespoon salt","1 1/2 teaspoons celery salt","1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper","1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder","1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard","1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin","2 cups cider vinegar","1/2 cup yellow (ballpark) mustard","2 teaspoons salt"],"prepSteps":["1.
