One might ask, \"Oh, but won't the bracing scent of pine make the dish taste of Christmas fir or, worse, freshly waxed parlor?\" It will not. The smoked needles impart a light, balsamic flavor akin to rosemary (indeed one might substitute a bundle of that herb in this recipe), and the light glaze allows the pine flavor to shine through. The overall effect proves an excellent complement to the moist, flaky fish this cooking technique yields. Should one desire a more intensely flavored glaze, one might make a bit extra to brush over the fish before serving.","hed":"Pine-Smoked & Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon","pubDate":"2011-08-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sarah Huck "},{"name":" Jaimee Young"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pine-smoked-maple-glazed-wild-salmon-366949","photoData":{"id":"54b2a9d111c5d6af478b1a0e","filename":"366949_wild-salmon_1x1.jpg","caption":"Pine-Smoked & Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon","credit":"Tara Donne","promoTitle":"Pine-Smoked & Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon","title":"Pine-Smoked & Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.67,"ingredients":["1 to 2 large handfuls green pine needles","1/2 cup bourbon","1/2 cup grade-B, freshly tapped maple syrup","3 tablespoons Dijon mustard","2 teaspoons freshly milled black pepper","Four 6-ounce salmon fillets, patted dry","Kosher salt, to taste","One 9-inch round wire cooling rack"],"prepSteps":["1.

But how to celebrate this verdant splendor, when one eats neither grass nor moss, neither leaf-lined branch nor bud? The salad bowl is just the place for a pageant of greenery, as one can fill it with a tender mix of lush edibles scooped from the field. We prefer a wild salad to be austerely dressed; too much accessorizing can distract from its simple beauty. A drizzle of lemon and oil and perhaps a scattering of edible blooms are all that are needed here.","hed":"Greens of the Wilderness Salad","pubDate":"2011-08-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sarah Huck "},{"name":" Jaimee Young"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/greens-of-the-wilderness-salad-366929","photoData":{"id":"56043a887c9cb37c518d5c8e","filename":"366929_hires.jpg","caption":"Greens of the Wilderness Salad","credit":"Tara Donne","promoTitle":"Greens of the Wilderness Salad","title":"Greens of the Wilderness Salad","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["8 cups mixed wild greens, such as purslane, dandelion (best used sparingly,","Sprightly Lemon Vinaigrette","Kosher salt, to taste","Freshly milled black pepper, to taste","Edible flowers, for garnish, optional"],"prepSteps":["Tear the greens into bite-size pieces and drop them into a large salad bowl.
