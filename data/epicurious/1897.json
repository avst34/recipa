Refrigerate the pan for 30 minutes to set the lemon curd completely before cutting into bars.

It also protects it from premature coagulation during the addition of the lemon juice. If the juice were added directly to the unprotected yolk, the yolk would partially coagulate and, when strained, a large percentage of it would be left behind in the strainer.

Immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the hot cream into the caramel.

For the greatest precision, use a pastry bag with a small decorating tube or a reclosable bag with a small piece cut from one corner.","Room temperature, up to 3 days; refrigerated, at least 3 months. To reheat: If the caramel is in a microwave-safe container at room temperature, microwave it on high power for 1 minute, stirring twice. If cold, it will take a few seconds more. Alternatively, place it in a bowl in a pan of simmering water and heat, stirring occasionally, until warm, about 7 minutes.","Refiner's or corn syrup helps to prevent the caramel sauce from crystallizing when stirred. It also lowers the caramelization temperature.","I adore the flavor of caramel, so I like to have as much depth of flavor as possible without any burnt flavor. I bring this caramel up to at least 380°F. for maximum flavor. The darker you make the caramel, the less sweet it will seem, but you risk burning it if you don't have an absolutely accurate thermometer.","It's best to have the cream hot and the butter at room temperature to avoid splattering when they are added to the hot caramel. Cold cream, however, speeds the cooling and is practical if you're pressured for time — but it must be added very slowly.","I do not recommend using crème fraîche in place of heavy cream, as it does not decrease sweetness to any significant degree nor does it add interest of flavor.","Unrefined sugar, which contains a small amount of natural molasses — which caramelizes at a slightly lower temperature — provides a flavor that is deliciously reminiscent of butterscotch. The \"impurities\" in unrefined sugar can cause crysallization so if you use it, care must be taken not to stir the caramel too much.","• Most important: When making caramel, be careful to concentrate every moment. Sugar burns are extremely painful.","• Use refined sugar that is absolutely free of impurities, to prevent crystallization.","• To further prevent crystallization, do not allow any sugar crystals to get on the sides of the pan, and be sure to moisten all the sugar with the water. Stop stirring entirely as soon as it comes to a boil. If using a thermometer, be sure to rinse it and dry it if removing and reinserting in the syrup. If any sugar remains on the thermometer, it will cause crystallization.","• Use a pan that conducts heat well (such as unlined copper, aluminum, or anodized aluminum) so that cooking stops soon after it is removed from the heat. Alternatively, have ready a larger pan or sink partly filled with cold water to immerse the bottom of the pan. Do not use a pan with a tin or nonstick lining, as its melting point is below that of caramel.*","• To determine the color of the caramel, use an accurate thermometer or drop a bit of caramel on a white surface such as a porcelain spoon or plate. When making spun sugar, too light a caramel produces a ghostly effect, too dark produces a brassy color when spun.","• To prevent breakage, never put a thermometer used for caramel into water until completely cooled.","• Soaking utensils in hot water will remove hardened caramel.","• After the caramel is prepared, do not stir it too much, as this may eventually cause crystallization.","*There are some special pans, such as the Scanpan, from Denmark, with nonstick properties that can withstand the heat of caramel."],"reviewsCount":22,"willMakeAgainPct":86},{"id":"54a44f9e19925f464b38d85d","dek":"It's best to serve this lobster salad right after you make it, rather than preparing it in advance.

(Setting it in a warm place will speed up the rehydration of the pearls.)","Shuck the oysters. Trim away the muscle and the outer ruffled edge of each oyster and place the trimmings in a saucepan. Reserve the whole trimmed oysters and strain the oyster juice into a separate bowl. You should have about 1/2 cup of juice.","In a bowl, whip 1/2 cup of the cream just until it holds its shape; reserve in the refrigerator.","Drain the softened tapioca in a strainer and discard the milk.

Whisk vigorously over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate as much air as possible. The finished sabayon will have thickened and lightened, the foam will have subsided, and the sabayon will hold a ribbon when it falls from the whisk. If the mixture begins to break, remove it from the heat and whisk quickly off the heat for a moment to recombine, then return to the heat.","Stir the hot sabayon into the tapioca, along with a generous amount of black pepper. Mix in the crème fraîche and the whipped cream. The tapioca will be a creamy pale yellow with the tapioca pearls suspended in the mixture.
