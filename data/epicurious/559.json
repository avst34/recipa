The type of whiskey you use will leave its own imprint on the sauce: Bourbon will make for a sweeter sauce, while rye will add some nice yeasty notes. Scotch will take it in a smokier direction. Do be careful when flambéing: Because this recipe calls for a generous amount of whiskey, the flames may shoot quite high (its a necessary step to take the edge off the alcohol).","hed":"Top Butt Steak with Whiskey Mustard Sauce","pubDate":"2008-09-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Ian Knauer"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/top-butt-steak-with-whiskey-mustard-sauce-350248","photoData":{"id":"54bd684ae231becc7f3d5817","filename":"butt-steak-whiskey-mustard-sauce-6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"photo by Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"","title":"Top Butt Steak with Whiskey Mustard Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Mustard","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.36,"ingredients":["1 (2- to 2 1/4-pounds) boneless top butt sirloin steak (about 1 inch thick)","1 tablespoon olive oil","2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot","1/2 cup whiskey","1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth","2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard","3 tablespoons unsalted butter","1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar"],"prepSteps":["Pat steak dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.","Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sear steak, turning once, about 8 minutes total for medium-rare.
