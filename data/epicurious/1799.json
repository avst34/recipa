One of my favorite versions is made by André Lerch, an Alsatian baker with a bread and pastry shop on the Left Bank.\nTo be truly appreciated — to \"invade the senses with exquisite pleasure\" as they did for Marcel Proust — Madeleines must be dipped in tea, ideally the slightly lime-flavoured tilleul, which releases the fragrant, flavorful lemon essence of the little tea cake.
