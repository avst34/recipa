Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan and place in the fridge while you make the filling.","Beat the cream cheese until smooth and add the sugar. Add the eggs and egg yolks, beating them in one by one until they are incorporated into the cream cheese and sugar. Pour in the sour cream, lime juice, vanilla extract and rum, and beat again until smooth and creamy. Finally fold in the sweetened chestnut purée. Don't worry about making a fully amalgamated mixture: smooth cream cheese with grainy streaks of chestnut is just fine.","Line the outside of the springform pan containing the crumb base with a good wrapping of plastic wrap, so that the whole of the bottom and sides are enveloped in plastic. Do the same with aluminum foil, covering the layer of plastic wrap to make a very watertight casing. Stand the springform, thus covered, in a roasting pan and pour in the chestnut filling. Once that's done, pour water from a recently boiled kettle into the roasting pan to come just over an inch up the side of the pan (the plastic wrap will make it bob up and down a bit) and place in the oven to cook for an hour.","When the cheesecake's ready it should be just set on top with a hint of wobble underneath; it certainly carries on cooking as it cools. Take the cheesecake out of the roasting pan, take off the foil and plastic wrap and let the cheesecake cool on a rack. Refrigerate overnight before unmolding and leaving it to get back to room temperature. If you need to unmold it long before you want to eat it (I often do just because I like to get all bothersome stuff out of the way before people arrive) then just sit it on its serving plate in the fridge until about 20–30 minutes before you want to eat it. I'd take it out as you sit down to dinner or lunch or whatever.","You can make the syrup in advance but do not pour over until the actual point of serving.","You just put all of the syrup ingredients into a saucepan and melt together. Let the syrup boil for 10 minutes, then cool to just warmish (or even room temperature) before criss-crossing the top of the cheesecake with it."],"reviewsCount":17,"willMakeAgainPct":93},{"id":"54a4389819925f464b388c9b","dek":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Feast: Food to Celebrate Life, _by Nigella Lawson._I'm not really one for cocktails and pitchers of funny drinks, but I came up with this a few years back and it was so good and the color so festive, I just had to go with it.","hed":"Seasonal Breeze","pubDate":"2006-11-09T20:37:08.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nigella Lawson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/seasonal-breeze-236620","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fruit Juice","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1,"ingredients":["1 bottle Campari","3 cups chilled blood orange juice (from a carton)","3 cups chilled cranberry juice (also from a carton)"],"prepSteps":["Mix the three components together, though you may find it easier to mix in smaller batches, making up more as you need it.

That means sweet and soft in the inside and with a thick golden-brown carapace of crunch without. And the strange thing is, no matter how many tricky things you can attempt and succeed at in cooking, no matter what elaborate techniques you might learn to master, nothing gives you that wholly happy yet unbrazen glow of pleasure in your achievement that cooking a good pan of roast potatoes does.\nA good roast potato isn't about showing off or about striving desperately to impress. Nor is it a difficult thing to achieve, but I can't pretend it isn't a high pressure zone. You either get it right or you don't, and anything less than perfect is a disappointment. It's brutal but it's the truth.\nHowever, unlike many things in cooking — and indeed life — it's relatively straightforward to achieve. That's to say, the crucial factor is the heat of the fat you roast the potatoes in. Get that right and the rest should follow. No reason why not.\nAnd you can do things that help: cut the potatoes fairly small, so that the ratio of crunch to soft middle is high; use goose fat as your frying medium; parboil the potatoes (nothing new here), only before you roast them, sprinkle them and bash them about with semolina. These are not exactly tricks, but they are my most useful pointers.\nThere is nothing further to say: this recipe is most pleasing for its simplicity.","hed":"Perfect Roast Potatoes","pubDate":"2006-11-09T20:28:37.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nigella Lawson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/perfect-roast-potatoes-236618","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Potato","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.55,"ingredients":["6 lbs medium potatoes","2 tablespoons semolina","2 cups goose fat*","*Goose fat is available on amazon.com, but Crisco is a good substitute."],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to the hottest possible temperature. I do this as soon as the turkey is out of the oven, which (for me) is very much later than the parboiling stage, but let's start with the oven since you may be cooking in different circumstances, or prefer different procedures.","Peel the potatoes, and cut each one into three by cutting off each end at a slant so that you are left with a wedge or triangle in the middle.","Put the potatoes into salted cold water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil, letting them cook for 4 minutes. Drain the potatoes into a colander and then tip back into the empty saucepan, sprinkling over the semolina. Shake the potatoes around to coat them well and, with the lid clamped on, give the pan a good rotation and the potatoes a proper bashing so that their edges disintegrate or fuzz and blur a little: this facilitates the crunch effect later.","Meanwhile, empty the goose fat into a large roasting pan and heat in the oven until seriously hot. (I often parboil the potatoes a few hours in advance, so the \"meanwhile\" doesn't always hold. And you can start heating up the fat in the oven that the turkey's in, turning it up to really hot once the bird comes out.) Then tip the semolina–coated potatoes carefully into the hot fat and roast in the oven for an hour or until they are darkly golden and crispy, turning them over halfway through cooking. If the oven's hot enough they probably won't need more than about 25 minutes a side; and it's better to let them sit in the oven (you can always pour off most of the fat and leave them in the pan) till the very last minute.","Boastfulness and vainglory are not attractive nor would I want to encourage them in you (or myself), but when you've cooked these and see them in all their golden glory on the table, I think you're allowed a quiet moment of silent pride."],"reviewsCount":23,"willMakeAgainPct":85},{"id":"54a4389119925f464b388c70","dek":"Editor's note: This recipe is from Ming Tsai's Simply Ming.\nThis recipe only uses 1/4 of Ming Tsai's butter shortbread cookie dough.
