have never understood why pudding has not inspired the same passion as the ubiquitous cupcake. Pudding is Americana personified and every bit as interesting and delicious as any other dessert, but for some reason it is not as glorified as some of its peers. Perhaps it's because pudding is not as visually exciting? In an attempt to add a bit of visual flair to puddin', we created a S'mores version that looks great in a clear glass (or glass container). To us, diner desserts equal layered desserts, and the layers of dark chocolate pudding look terrific with the alternate layers of toasted graham. The marshmallow topping is both tasty and a tad sexy.

And we couldn't be happier: We love the complex layering of flavors in real Mexican cooking. Mole, the signature sauce of Mexico, is a particularly delicious example of this trend. The only problem? Traditional mole usually requires a pantry's worth of ingredients and an entire day in the kitchen. Here, weve streamlined the ingredient list—and figured out how to make an incredible sauce in a couple of hours. But this simplified version doesn't skimp on flavor. Mexican chocolate adds an intriguing complexity to the smoky, savory sauce.

Today, even landlocked cities have seafood counters swimming with delicious (and colorful) options. One of our favorites is beautifully pink wild salmon. It looks great, tastes wonderful, and is packed with good-for-you omega-3 fatty acids. Plus, wild salmon (ideally from Alaska) is better for the environment than farmed salmon. Round out the meal with a side of your favorite mix of seasonal vegetables (preferably from your local farmers' market) and—if you're craving yet more color—lemon wedges.","hed":"Herb-Roasted Salmon, Potatoes, Carrots, and Sugar Snap Peas","pubDate":"2009-03-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jeanne Thiel Kelley"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/herb-roasted-salmon-potatoes-carrots-and-sugar-snap-peas-352633","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Herb","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.36,"ingredients":["2 green onions, chopped","2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill","2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro","1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint","1 tablespoon coriander seeds","4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus additional for brushing","","2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided","2 garlic cloves, pressed, divided","1 teaspoon finely grated lemon peel, divided","4 6-ounce salmon fillets (preferably wild)","1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt","1 tablespoon tahini (sesame seed paste)*","12 ounces fingerling potatoes, scrubbed, halved lengthwise","1 bunch baby carrots, trimmed","8 ounces sugar snap peas, strings removed","Lemon wedges"],"prepSteps":["Toss green onions, dill, cilantro, and mint in small bowl.

The long rest will make the meat extra-juicy. Bone-in heirloom rib chops have ample marbling, so the meat will be naturally moist. They dont need to rest as long with the salt rub—an hour or two should be sufficient.
