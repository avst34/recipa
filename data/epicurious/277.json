is a simple way to prepare whole fish, yet one that few Western cooks have mastered. In the Vietnamese culture, a properly steamed fish is a benchmark for chefs, and those who can't do it right are considered to be bad cooks. A perfectly steamed fish has flesh that is just cooked at the bone, never dry. Typically, whole fish are not served with the liquid in which it was steamed, which is too fishy tasting, and any sauce is added at the end, after the fish has been cooked. In this classic Chinese preparation, the fish is topped with scallions, cilantro and ginger, then doused with hot oil, which releases the flavor of the aromatics into the flesh of the fish.","hed":"Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger, Scallions, and Soy","pubDate":"2012-09-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Charles Phan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/steamed-whole-fish-with-ginger-scallions-and-soy-51115200","photoData":{"id":"54b082b81cc76a014cfaa5a5","filename":"51115200_steamed-whole-fish_1x1.jpg","caption":"Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger, Scallions, and Soy ","credit":"Eric Wolfinger","promoTitle":"Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger, Scallions, and Soy ","title":"Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger, Scallions, and Soy ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.78,"ingredients":["1 (1 1/2-pound) whole white fish (such as sea bass, branzino, or flounder), cleaned with head and tail intact","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","","2 by 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely julienned","1/4 cup light soy sauce","1 tablespoon rice wine","1 scallion, white and light green parts only, julienned","4 cilantro sprigs","1/2 cup canola oil"],"prepSteps":["1.
