Our lemon loaf recipe is very straightforward. We do not add poppy seeds, pecans, or any other extraneous ingredient. We really feel that the most important aspect of a lemon loaf is the zingy lemon flavor, and we accentuate it by using a combination of freshly squeezed lemon juice, freshly grated lemon zest, and a mildly sweet lemon syrup. The sour cream gives this loaf a subtle tang and a dense, moist crumb that cannot be achieved with yogurt. If you want to increase the lemony goodness of these cakes, add the simple glaze after the syrup has set and the cakes are cool. This loaf freezes extremely well, so you can double the recipe and make a few extra loaves.","hed":"Lemon Lemon Loaf","pubDate":"2008-12-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Matt Lewis"},{"name":" Renato Poliafito"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lemon-lemon-loaf-350989","photoData":{"id":"54be7c032a4b69f8647ece35","filename":"lemon-lemon-loaf-6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"photo by Tina Rupp","promoTitle":"","title":"Lemon Lemon Loaf","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.46,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups cake flour","1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour","2 teaspoons baking powder","1/4 teaspoon baking soda","1 teaspoon salt","2 1/4 cups sugar","8 large eggs, at room temperature","1/4 cup grated lemon zest (from about 4 lemons)","1/4 cup fresh lemon juice","2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled","1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature","2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","1/3 cup fresh lemon juice","1/3 cup sugar","2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted, or more if needed","4 to 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
