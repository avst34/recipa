To read more about Tyler Florence and to get his tips on throwing a Super Bowl party, click here.\nCod was once one of the most valuable commodities in the world — it was the sustainable protein for most of Europe for about five hundred years. Before refrigeration, most of Europe survived on salted, air-dried cod fillets (salt cod) and Portugal has been one of the largest producers for hundreds of years.\nWhen used in cooking, salt cod is first soaked to remove much of the salt. It is reconstructed in simmering milk enhanced with garlic and then used a million different ways: as a means of adding salt to food (similar to the way anchovies are used), folded into stews, or mixed with creamy, soft, cooked potatoes to form bacalao, the Portuguese national dish.\nThis is my take on bacalao. I've spiked the potato mix with chopped parsley and cilantro, which gives it a very fresh, clean flavor, and then quickly fried small bits into crisp, golden fritters. Squeeze fresh lemon over the top and you've got a fantastic hors d'oeuvre that's original and very easy to make.","hed":"Portuguese-Style Salt Cod Fritters with Lemon and Olives","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:28.000Z","author":[{"name":"Tyler Florence"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/portuguese-style-salt-cod-fritters-with-lemon-and-olives-233768","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.17,"ingredients":["1 pound dried, boneless salt cod","2 cups milk","3 garlic cloves","2 bay leaves","1/2 small bunch fresh thyme","4 starchy potatoes, such as Idaho","1 large onion, finely chopped","2 garlic cloves, minced","1 handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped","1 handful fresh cilantro, chopped","2 large eggs","1 to 2 tablespoons milk, as needed","Freshly ground black pepper","Kosher salt, if needed","Peanut oil, for frying","1 cup oil-cured black olives","Lemon wedges, for serving"],"prepSteps":["Starting a day ahead, soak the dried cod in cold water for 18 to 24 hours, changing the water several times to remove the majority of the salt. Drain the cod, rinse, and put it in a large pot. Add the milk, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and enough water to cover the cod by 1 inch; cooking the cod in milk keeps it very moist.

Season with a pinch of pepper and taste for salt — you probably won't need to add any, as the cod itself is still salty in spit of having been soaked and boiled.","With lightly moistened hands or using two tablespoons, shape the cod mixture into egg-shaped balls — you should get about 25. (The cod balls can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day before cooking, or frozen in a tightly covered container for several weeks.)","Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep, heavy skillet or pot to 370°F on a deep-fry thermometer.

Carefully lift them our of the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on a platter lined with paper towels. Keep going to cook all of the fritters.

To read more about Tyler Florence and to get his tips on throwing a Super Bowl party, click here.\nThere's a restaurant in Barcelona off la Ramblas — the \"walking district\" — called Las Turcoles, which means charcoal. You walk down an unassuming cobblestone street and into an even more unassuming bar. To get to the restaurant you walk through the kitchen where there are fifteen Spaniards standing around a train-engine of a coal-fed stove. The place looks and smells like Spain at its finest: paprika, chorizo, hams, and garlic.\nI knew I was in the right place when I got to the bottom of my dish. The rice was toasted and crunchy, like a perfect paella should be. Using a method called socarrat, the chefs crank up the heat under the rice really high once it's cooked through, until they smell the rice begin to toast, and then shut it off.
