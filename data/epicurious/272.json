Traditionally, a smaller olla filled with water placed on top of the pot serves as both a lid and a way to heat the water that occasionally needs to be added to the beans. Fuel is often scarce and this is a practical way to conserve precious wood.\nThese brothy beans, cooked with lots of water and just a scattering of herbs, onion, and garlic, are the classic bean dish of Mexico. They are often served as soupy frijoles caldos, ladled into small bowls, the beans submerged in their broth, and offered toward the end of a meal so no one leaves the table hungry. Or, they are served as frijoles cocidos, the beans drained slightly to accompany grilled meats or tacos.\nNo matter whether the beans are cooked in an olla, Dutch oven, or other heavy pot, the procedure will be the same. All that needs to be adjusted is the length of the cooking time. The fresher the beans are, the less cooking time is needed, but 2 1/2 to 3 hours is a reasonable estimate, although 4 hours or more is not unusual.","hed":"Frijoles de la Olla","pubDate":"2012-10-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marilyn Tausend "},{"name":" Ricardo Muñoz Zurita"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/frijoles-de-la-olla-51123600","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 pound dried beans (2 2/3 cups large beans or 3 cups small beans)","1/4 white onion","1 head garlic, outer papery skin removed and halved crosswise","1 tablespoon freshly rendered pork lard or canola or safflower oil","3 sprigs fresh epazote, or 6 sprigs fresh cilantro (epazote is the herb of choice for black beans)","1 teaspoon sea salt","Salsa Negra con Chipotles (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Rinse and sort the beans, discarding any broken pieces. Put in an olla or large, heavy pot, add 3 quarts water, and bring to a boil over high heat. This may take from 10 minutes in an enameled cast iron Dutch oven to 30 minutes in the traditional clay pot. When the water begins to bubble, immediately lower the heat to a gentle simmer and add the onion, garlic, and lard. Cover partially and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 hours. If the beans are not covered by at least 1 inch of water, add hot water. Add the epazote or cilantro, stir in the salt, and continue to simmer until the beans are almost soft, maybe 2 hours more. The centers of these beans should not be al dente.","Taste and add more salt if needed, then remove the pot from the heat and spoon out and discard the onion, garlic, and herb sprigs.

That was when Ricardo began to understand the various stages of bean cookery. The first stage, frijoles chinos, is a common way of cooking beans in and around Mexico City. The name confusingly refers to the way the bean texture resembles the tightly curled hair of African slaves brought to Mexico in the middle of the sixteenth century.\nThis same preparation is typically called frijoles fritos by cooks in central Mexico, though it differs somewhat as the beans are served before they have absorbed all of the broth and are still somewhat runny.\nYou can make fried beans from almost any type of dried bean. The diminutive black bean is commonly used in southern Mexico and red or brown beans are popular in the rest of the country. If you are in a hurry, an equal amount of canned beans may be substituted with additional water added to the can liquid if needed.\nThese tasty beans are served in homes and in small market fondas almost any time of the day. They partner perfectly with grilled meat and egg dishes, such as Huevos al Albanil. Serve them in a separate small, flat dish or as a side on the main plate. A light sprinkle of fresh cheese will provide a color and taste contrast.","hed":"Frijoles Chinos o Fritos","pubDate":"2012-10-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marilyn Tausend "},{"name":" Ricardo Muñoz Zurita"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/frijoles-chinos-o-fritos-51123800","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1/4 cup freshly rendered pork lard, bacon fat, or canola or safflower oil","1/4 cup finely chopped white onion","1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic","2 1/2 cups drained Frijoles de la Olla , plus 1 cup bean broth","1/2 teaspoon sea salt","1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco"],"prepSteps":["Heat the lard in a skillet over medium-high heat.
