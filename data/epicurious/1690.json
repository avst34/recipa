People thought it strange — sending coals to Newcastle — but at that time Sara Lee did not make cookies (I wasn't about to compete with the cheesecake operation), and everyone seemed to enjoy them. In your January 2001 issue, I read about the different cakes and had a desire to try the devil's food one, since my husband loves chocolate. I made the recipe as 24 cupcakes and decided to use a frosting recipe I have had since I was married, over 50 years ago. As a little girl, my favorite birthday cake was chocolate with white frosting, and when I took my first bite of your recipe, there I was: ten years old again. I thought you might like to have that frosting recipe.\"\nWe took Mrs. Schwartz's advice and tried her almond cream cheese frosting on our devil's food cupcakes — it was delicious.\nActive time: 10 min Start to finish: 30 min","hed":"Almond Cream Cheese Frosting","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gert Schwartz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/almond-cream-cheese-frosting-105946","photoData":{"id":"560ea8a9f9a84192308a9ce9","filename":"105946.jpg","caption":"Almond Cream Cheese Frosting","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Almond Cream Cheese Frosting","title":"Almond Cream Cheese Frosting","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.71,"ingredients":["2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar","4 oz cream cheese, softened","1/4 teaspoon almond extract","1 tablespoon whole milk"],"prepSteps":["Sift confectioners sugar over cream cheese in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer at moderate speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
