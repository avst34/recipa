Don't forget to mix everything well before serving, since bits of salsa and green onions rise to the top during baking.","hed":"Red Chile Rice with Shrimp and Bacon","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Rick Bayless"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/red-chile-rice-with-shrimp-and-bacon-100675","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["4 thick slices smoked bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces","2 cups rice, preferably medium grain","2 cups Mellow Red Chile Salsa","1 1/2 cups hot rich-tasting chicken broth or hot water","1/2 teaspoon salt","4 green onions, sliced crosswise 1/4 inch thick","1 pound medium-large (about 24) shrimp, peeled and deveined","1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro"],"prepSteps":["Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
