They may be a relatively recent development in the world of Christstollen, which dates back to the Middle Ages, but they more than make up for their youth. In other words, want the rich, buttery, spicy flavor of Stollen without the work of a yeasted dough and the weeks of impatiently waiting for the loaves to be ready? If so, Stollenkonfekt is the thing for you.","hed":"Bite-Size Stollen (Stollenkonfekt)","pubDate":"2016-11-04T01:49:59.043Z","author":[{"name":"Luisa Weiss"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/bite-size-stollen-stollenkonfekt","photoData":{"id":"5846ff05abd8719c6e734039","filename":"Stollenkonfekt-12012016.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Katherine Sacks","promoTitle":"","title":"Stollenkonfekt","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"occasion","name":"Christmas","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["7 tablespoons/100g unsalted high-fat, European-style butter, at room temperature","1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/80g granulated sugar","1 cup/250g Quark, drained if necessary","Grated peel of 1 organic lemon","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 tablespoon dark rum","2 1/3 cups, scooped and leveled, plus 1 tablespoon/ 300g all-purpose flour","1/4 teaspoon salt","3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/2 teaspoon ground cloves","1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom","1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder","1/2 cup/75g blanched whole almonds, chopped","1 cup/150g raisins","7 tablespoons/100g unsalted butter","13 tablespoons/100g confectioners’ sugar","3 tablespoons Vanilla Sugar"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.

The sugar is more intensely flavored than regular vanilla sugar.
