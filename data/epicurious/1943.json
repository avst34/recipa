If the fish is good, there is nothing better. The gravlaks found in American markets is normally very mild, sometimes slightly scented, often with dried dill. Fresh dill has a taste that is discreet and subtle; it flavors the salmon nicely without competing with the fish's own flavors.\nSome cookbooks suggest freezing the salmon before you prepare it, to get rid of harmful microorganisms; with modern hygienic treatment of fish, this should not be a big issue. If you do freeze it, do it after it has been cured. Some of the proteins that may be damaged when freezing fresh fish will have broken down in the cured fish, so gravlaks can stand up to freezing better than fresh salmon can. The gravlaks will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator.\nGravlaks is normally served as one of many cold dishes in a buffet or smorgasbord. Serve with Sweet Mustard Sauce and scrambled eggs and dark rye bread for open-faced sandwiches, or with pickles and capers.","hed":"Gravlaks with Sweet Mustard Sauce","pubDate":"2003-01-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andreas Viestad"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/gravlaks-with-sweet-mustard-sauce-234998","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Mustard","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["Two 3-pound salmon fillets, skin on, any pinbones removed","1/3 cup salt","2/3 cup sugar","1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper","3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill","1 teaspoon dill seeds","Sweet Mustard Sauce"],"prepSteps":["Rinse the fillets in cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.

A deli in the home of my alma mater. It's not really a deli but more of an international food emporium like New York's Zabar's with a definite Jewish touch. Mr. Weinzweig, a drop-out Ph.D. candidate, has taken an academic and appetizing interest in updating Jewish recipes like mushroom and barley soup, going back in history to the nineteenth-century Eastern European version similar to that served at New York's Second Avenue Deli.","hed":"Zingerman's Ann Arbor Mushroom and Barley Soup","pubDate":"1998-09-17T19:09:30.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Nathan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/zingermans-ann-arbor-mushroom-and-barley-soup-40019","photoData":{"id":"57ab6c574e25a29659d81b4c","filename":"zingermans-ann-arbor-mushroom-and-barley-soup.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"zingermans-ann-arbor-mushroom-and-barley-soup.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.58,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons dried porcini mushrooms","2 tablespoons margarine","1 large onion, thinly sliced","2 ribs celery with leaves, diced","1/4 cup parsley","1 carrot, peeled and sliced","3 cloves garlic, chopped","1 pound fresh porcini or other mushrooms","1 tablespoon flour","2 quarts beef broth or water","1 cup whole barley","2 teaspoons salt"],"prepSteps":["1.

Jennie June Croley was one of the first American newspaper women and founder of the Sorosis Club. In her only cookbook she included a chapter on Jewish \"receipts,\" which probably came to her from her Jewish friend, Genie H. Rosenfeld. \"These are all original and reliable, -- the contribution of a superior Jewish housekeeper in New York,\" she wrote. Mrs. Rosenfeld was the wife of the dramatist, Sydney Rosenfeld, who was also the first editor of Puck.\nThis nineteenth-century recipe cooks well today. The slow sautéing of the onions along with the nutmeg, mace, and thyme enhances the taste of the chicken. Serve it with rice.","hed":"Jennie June's Brown Fricassée Chicken","pubDate":"1998-09-17T19:09:30.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Nathan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/jennie-junes-brown-fricassee-chicken-40018","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.13,"ingredients":["1 4-pound frying chicken, cut up into 8 pieces","6 tablespoons olive oil","6 medium onions, sliced in rings","1 clove garlic, minced","2 tomatoes, peeled, or 1 16-ounce can stewing tomatoes with liquid","1 sprig fresh thyme","Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste","","1/2 teaspoon allspice","Dash of mace","1/2 cup water"],"prepSteps":["1.
