Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and pat scallops dry. Toss scallops in cumin mixture to coat. Hold 2 skewers parallel to each other and about 1/2 inch apart. Thread 6 scallops onto skewers so flat sides can lie flat on grill. (Each scallop should be pierced by both skewers. This prevents scallops from spinning when turning them over on grill.)

Grill scallops, turning occasionally, until just cooked through, about 4 minutes on each side. (If grilling is out of the question, scallions, zucchini, and scallops—not on skewers—can all be cooked in a large nonstick skillet: Lightly brush skillet with oil and heat over moderately high heat until hot before cooking vegetables and scallops separately.)","Toss zucchini with beans and serve topped with scallions and scallops and garnished with cilantro."],"reviewsCount":18,"willMakeAgainPct":83},{"id":"54a4145d19925f464b3755ba","dek":"","hed":"Greek New Year's Cake","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/greek-new-years-cake-2853","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Greek","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.67,"ingredients":["1 cups (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature","1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon sugar","3 eggs, separated","2 eggs","2 tablespoons water","2 teaspoons vanilla extract","3 cups all purpose flour","1 teaspoon baking powder","1/4 teaspoon salt","1 quarter, washed, wrapped in foil","1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds (about 2 ounces)","2 tablespoons sesame seeds"],"prepSteps":["Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325°F.
