you are the cook around the house, you know how sweet the words \"I love this. Please make it again!\" sound. This side has become my go-to dish for something quick and pretty, as I love the juxtaposition of the two shades of green. After you remove the leaves from the brussels sprouts, this takes only minutes to prepare. Brussels sprouts are miniature balls of cabbage, so their stems can be pretty tough. By working from the outermost leaf inward, and cutting more of the stem whenever necessary, you follow the pattern of the sprout to easily remove its leaves. You can do this part in advance, but you'll want to sauté them just before serving.\nMarcona almonds are blanched Spanish almonds that are sweeter than American almonds. They can run on the expensive side, but I have seen them at both Trader Joe's and Costco for a reasonable price. You don't need a lot of them, but their flavor is really special on top of this plate of tender greens.","hed":"Brussel Leaf and Baby Spinach Sauté","pubDate":"2012-10-11T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sara Forte"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/brussel-leaf-and-baby-spinach-saute-51120220","photoData":{"id":"54b0659b1cc76a014cfa85ee","filename":"51120220_brussel-leaf-baby-spinach_1x1.jpg","caption":"Brussel Leaf and Baby Spinach Saut&eacute;","credit":"Hugh Forte","promoTitle":"Brussel Leaf and Baby Spinach Saut&eacute;","title":"Brussel Leaf and Baby Spinach Saut&eacute;","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.7,"ingredients":["1 pound brussels sprouts","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1 tablespoon white wine or champagne vinegar","1 tablespoon maple syrup","4 cups baby spinach","2 generous pinches of sea salt","1/2 cup Marcona almonds"],"prepSteps":["Working with one brussels sprout at a time, peel each individual leaf, starting from the outside and working toward the middle.

You could likely just copy it without a recipe. The point I do want to stress, however, is the necessity of making your own salad dressings. There is all sorts of junk in store-bought dressings and they don't taste nearly as fresh—not to mention that it's ridiculously easy to whisk a few things together or put them in a mini blender. This particular dressing hovers around the vinaigrette family, with just enough crème fraîche to coat the leaves with the thinnest amount of creaminess. Be sure your leaves are cleaned and fully dry so the dressing can cling on.

In this dish, its short time in the oven helps it to retain most of its structure, but make sure that the oil really coats the kale, since if you use too little you will get something more like kale chips. If you use curly kale, which is less tender than lacinato kale, or you prefer your greens more wilted, you could sauté it quickly instead. I use lots of liquid in the millet, so the result is nice and soft but bound together by the sharply flavored cheese. The bits of millet are still detectable, but it has a comfort food texture.

At this point I count on one hand how many times I had made a tart, so I was pleasantly surprised when this went over as well as it did.\nI will not lie; this tart has a fair number of steps and will leave you with a sink full of dishes, but it's well worth it. If you like, you can make the tart shell, roast the squash, and sauté the chard a day in advance, then bring everything to room temperature before assembling it. Make sure that there are no holes in the tart crust and that it is completely cooked before adding the filling. I've had the egg mixture leak through the crust before, so hopefully I'm sparing you the same frustration.","hed":"Buckwheat Harvest Tart","pubDate":"2012-10-11T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sara Forte"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/buckwheat-harvest-tart-51120600","photoData":{"id":"54b064771cc76a014cfa8393","filename":"51120600_buckwheat-harvest-tart_1x1.jpg","caption":"Buckwheat Harvest Tart","credit":"Hugh Forte","promoTitle":"Buckwheat Harvest Tart","title":"Buckwheat Harvest Tart","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Leafy Green","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.57,"ingredients":["1 cup buckwheat flour","3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour","1/2 teaspoon sea salt","1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes","2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves","1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar","2 to 3 tablespoons cold water","3 cups cubed butternut squash (1/4-inch cubes)","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","","1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","2 cloves garlic, minced","1 bunch Swiss chard, stems removed, coarsely chopped (about 6 cups chopped)","1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes","1 small yellow onion","2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar","3 eggs","1 cup grated Gruyère"],"prepSteps":["To make the crust, in a food processor, add both flours and the salt and pulse to combine.
