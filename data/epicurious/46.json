Be ready to serve and eat the frittata as soon as it is done cooking; for the best texture and flavor, do not let it stand on keep warm. The frittata needs maximum surface area to cook, so it works best in a large oval slow cooker. Serve with fried potatoes, or fruit salad and ciabatta toast.","hed":"Slow-Cooker Asparagus and Zucchini Frittata","pubDate":"2016-11-01T17:57:11.527Z","author":[{"name":"Beth Hensperger"},{"name":"Julie Kaufmann"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/slow-cooker-asparagus-and-zucchini-frittata","photoData":{"id":"58223de09de3520d2eb0020a","filename":"Slow-Cooker-Frittata_00154_12374521_FINAL.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Matt Duckor, Food Styling by Molly Baz","promoTitle":"","title":"Slow-Cooker Frittata ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Slow Cooker","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2,"ingredients":["3 tablespoons olive oil","2 medium-size shallots, chopped","8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces on the diagonal","1 medium-size zucchini, sliced 1/2-inch thick","12 large eggs","1 cup grated Parmesan cheese","1/4 cup chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley leaves","Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","5-7-qt. oval slow-cooker"],"prepSteps":["In a medium-size skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat and add the shallots, asparagus, and zucchini.
