Drain off the oil — leaving a light film of oil on the steaks — and salt the steaks on both sides. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over a high setting. When hot add the steaks and char on one side. Turn the heat down to medium and continue cooking for about 3 minutes for medium rare. Turn the steaks with tongs and turn up the heat to high. Be careful not to cut into the steaks while turning so that you don't lose any of the juices. Sear the second side of the steaks, then turn the heat to medium and cook for another 3 minutes to medium rare. Add 2 to 3 minutes per side for well-done steaks. Serve with a green salad, Aji Asado (roasted marinated peppers), and Papas al Horno (roasted potatoes).","If using an electric oven broiler, char one side of the steaks on a high broil on a preheated broiler pan with the rack as close as possible to the broiler element. When browned, turn steaks with tongs and brown the other side. Total cooking time with this method is about 5 minutes per side for medium rare.","Less time is required for gas broilers and outdoor charcoal barbecues. If using the latter, char meat directly on a rack over very hot coals on the hottest part of the barbecue, then move the meat to a cooler area of the rack over the drip pan leaving the barbecue lid open about one inch. Return the meat to the hotter area to char the second side and then move it back over the drip pan."],"reviewsCount":5,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a4340a6529d92b2c016bb8","dek":"This recipe is adapted from Argentine chef Francis Mallman. Mallman also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.\nThis savory first course is Mallman's version of a traditional recipe from the painted-desert Argentine province of Salta. With their corn-husk wrapping humitas are somewhat similar to the spongier Central American tamal.\nThis is one of the rare but significant Argentine dishes that reflects South America's Incan heritage. For the most part, Indian influences are muted in Argentine cooking, except for the country's enduring passion for grilling over an open fire. But Mallman is enraptured by the traditions of the Incas, with their mud ovens and, as he puts it, \"the worship of peppers, potatoes, pumpkins, and tomatoes ... all that magic and mystery.\"","hed":"Andean Humita en Chala","pubDate":"2006-09-05T02:21:50.000Z","author":[{"name":"Francis Mallman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/andean-humita-en-chala-230683","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon olive oil","1 medium white onion, finely chopped","8 ears fresh corn","Salt and pepper","","1/2 cup whole milk","1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper flakes"],"prepSteps":["Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.
