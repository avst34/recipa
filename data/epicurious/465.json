Even though this terrine is labor-intensive, it's not as fussy and last-minute as quenelles, and its ethereal texture rivals theirs. The salmon roe adds sparkle and zing both on the plate and on the palate, but if you want to take the terrine in a slightly different direction, use a small dice of blanched, peeled carrot in its place. You'll get a delicate crunch instead of a briny pop in the mouth.","hed":"White Fish Terrine with Salmon Roe and Dill","pubDate":"2009-07-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/white-fish-terrine-with-salmon-roe-and-dill-233244","photoData":{"id":"560dd6dc7b55306961bfa87f","filename":"233244.jpg","caption":"White Fish Terrine with Salmon Roe and Dill","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"White Fish Terrine with Salmon Roe and Dill","title":"White Fish Terrine with Salmon Roe and Dill","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2,"ingredients":["1 1/4 lb skinless cod, scrod, or gray sole fillets, well chilled","2 teaspoons kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt","","1/4 teaspoon white pepper","1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","1 large egg white","2 cups chilled heavy cream","2 tablespoons minced fresh dill","3 tablespoons salmon roe","","","","","","Accompaniment:beurre blanc","a 4-cup terrine mold or loaf pan; a tamis (drum sieve) with 30 to 40 holes per square centimeter*; a slightly flexible bowl scraper; a kitchen scale; an offset spatula; an instant-read thermometer"],"prepSteps":["Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F.

His old band, Archers of Loaf, was the car stereo soundtrack to many nights of sipping Slurpees with my best friends in high school. When Archers disbanded, Eric started Crooked Fingers — named for his grandfather's CB handle — and my boyfriend, Pete, played me their first record on our first date. On our first vacation together, we found that our North Carolinian pals were also big Archers of Loaf fans and had actually been to their last show ever. In the dark, junkyard-like backyard of their crappy local bar, they broke out into an a cappella version of \"Web in Front,\" which remains the most joyful, punk rock thing I've ever heard. In that moment, I felt so lucky that my life was happening to me.\nBut, because I'm a bit of a pessimist, I really hoped I'd never meet Eric Bachmann. I feared that no mortal man could measure up to his music and all the memories I had tied up in it. So, when we saw him standing around at SXSW (Austin's springtime indie rock fest), Pete literally had to push me to talk to him about the cookbook. Turns out, Eric has worked in restaurants all his life. He loves to cook, and he mentioned this seared tuna dish, which, by the way, is ridiculously easy to make and very impressive. When he emailed me the recipe, it came with a note that said, \"Thanks for allowing me to be a part of your project . . . it's a real honor.\" The pleasure is all mine.","hed":"Seared Tuna with Wasabi-Coconut Sauce and Roasted-Pepper Rice Pilaf","pubDate":"2009-07-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Kara Zuaro"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/seared-tuna-with-wasabi-coconut-sauce-and-roasted-pepper-rice-pilaf-238626","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.11,"ingredients":["1 cup uncooked white rice","1 red bell pepper","olive oil","2 big handfuls of fresh spinach leaves that have been washed carefully","1 garlic clove, minced","1 tablespoon white wine vinegar","1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk","2-3 tablespoons sugar","2-3 tablespoons wasabi powder","6- to 8-ounce cut of sashimi-grade tuna","shredded coconut and/or parsley (for garnish)"],"prepSteps":["1.
