Yields about 1 1/2 cups.","Cut the onions in quarters, dice the quince, and simmer slowly in a pot with 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. The vegetables shouldn't take on any color. Add the grapefruit zest, vanilla seed and pepper. Pour the wine and the langoustine broth; reduce quickly on the stove. When the liquid has been halved, add the remaining butter. Continue until the sauce reaches a desired consistency (about 15 minutes). Add the chili and mint; let them infuse for a few minutes and strain the sauce. Reserve for final assembly of the dish.","Peel the salsify and slice into two inch pieces on the bias. Season with salt and olive oil. In a sauté pan, add half the duck fat; pan fry the salsify, add the chicken stock and butter. Cook quickly on the stove. Reduce the stock completely and remove the salsify. Heat a clean frying pan until it’s very warm, pour the remaining duck fat, and roast the salsify until it has a golden color. Season with pepper and \"fleur de sel.\" Reserve on the side until you are ready to plate the dish.","Mix all the ingredients together; macerate the basil (whole leaves) in the vinaigrette. Season the broccoli sprouts with the truffle vinaigrette right before serving.","All of the ingredients are served warm with the exception of the broccoli sprouts. Make sure that you have all of the components of the dish ready for plating before you cook the shellfish — salsify and sauce are warm and broccoli sprouts are dressed with the vinaigrette. When you are ready to serve, heat a saut  pan, add the remaining shellfish butter and place the seasoned shellfish in the pan. After about 1 minute, turn the shellfish over and finish cooking (2 to 3 minutes).","Arrange the salsify around the plate. Put the langoustine tails on top (tail out) and the dressed broccoli sprouts in the center of the plate. Spoon Chardonnay reduction over langoustine tails and serve immediately."],"reviewsCount":7,"willMakeAgainPct":75},{"id":"54a469ff6529d92b2c027be6","dek":"From my mom, Kathy Spivey.
