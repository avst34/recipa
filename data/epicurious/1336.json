It's fun to go into their classrooms and help out with projects and reading groups, but those activities leave little time for cooking.\nWhen I do get into the kitchen, I make dishes that are simple and delicious—which isn't easy given the different eating styles in my family. My daughters, Cassandra and Melinda, request hot dogs and pizza every night. Plus, they're quite the little cookie monsters. On the other hand, my husband, Mike, is a real meat-and-potatoes guy who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. Although it's hard to come up with a compromise every night, I can usually put together a quick and flavorful steak dish with a batch of freshly baked cookies for dessert.
