Plump and irregularly shaped, they're seasonally available in Paris markets, with their leaves still attached. They are prized by chefs and cooks for their intense lemony flavor (without the harshness of commercial lemons), and their not-too-bitter pith, which makes them perfect for preserving.\nThis nutty, lemony salad makes good use of preserved lemons, which you can easily buy or make yourself (see my website for a recipe). I keep a jar on hand at all times. They take a few weeks to mellow and soften, so don't save making them for the last minute. Their flavor is incomparable, and a jar will last for months in your refrigerator. Chopped-up bits can be tossed with olives for a quick apéro, and they also add an assertive citrus flavor to this dish made with pistachios and Israeli couscous.\nIsraeli couscous are little pearls of pasta, elsewhere called pastina, which means \"little pasta,\" and when toasted it's known as fregola sarda. Since they have more substance, I think they hold up a little better to North African-style braised meats, like the lamb shank tagine, than traditional couscous. (Orzo is a good substitute for the Israeli couscous.) To change things around a bit, you can vary the dried fruit or swap in fresh mint or cilantro for the parsley. Another nut, such as toasted hazelnuts or almonds or even pine nuts, could be used in place of the pistachios.","hed":"Lemon-Pistachio Israeli Couscous","pubDate":"2014-03-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David Lebovitz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lemon-pistachio-israeli-couscous-51232810","photoData":{"id":"54ac8b0119925f464b3ab98a","filename":"51232810_israeli-couscous_1x1.jpg","caption":"Lemon-Pistachio Israeli Couscous","credit":"Ed Anderson &copy; 2014","promoTitle":"Lemon-Pistachio Israeli Couscous","title":"Lemon-Pistachio Israeli Couscous","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.33,"ingredients":["1 preserved lemon","1/2 cup (30g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","2 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, at room temperature","1/2 cup (80g) diced dried fruit (any combination of cherries, cranberries, apricots, prunes, or raisins)","1/2 cup (65g) unsalted (shelled) pistachios, very coarsely chopped (almost whole)","3/4 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt","1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1 1/4 cups (225g) Israeli couscous or another small round pasta","Freshly ground black pepper"],"prepSteps":["1.

Hence it's largely unknown to folks outside of France. Paule Caillat gave me her family recipe, to which I made a few changes (authorized, of course). The dumplings are made of pâte à choux dough, similar to that used for profiteroles.\nThey're partially cooked by poaching them first, then baking, where they'll puff up gloriously before settling down, waiting to be scooped up from under a blanket of browned cheese. This is a pretty rich dish; serve it with a simple green salad.","hed":"Parisian Gnocchi","pubDate":"2014-03-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David Lebovitz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/parisian-gnocchi-51233010","photoData":{"id":"56033a2fc301a9f945ef83b0","filename":"51233010_hires.jpg","caption":"Parisian Gnocchi ","credit":"Ed Anderson &copy; 2014","promoTitle":"Parisian Gnocchi ","title":"Parisian Gnocchi ","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 1/4 cups (310ml) water","7 tablespoons (3 1/2 ounces/100g) unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed","1/2 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt","1 1/4 cups (175g) all-purpose flour","4 large eggs, at room temperature","2 teaspoons dry mustard powder","5 tablespoons (2 1/2 ounces/70g) salted or unsalted butter","1/3 cup (45g) all-purpose flour","3 cups (750ml) whole or low-fat milk, warmed","1 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt","Generous pinch of cayenne pepper","1 3/4 cups (140g) grated Swiss-style cheese, such as Emmenthal, Gruyère, or Comté","1/3 cup (1 ounce/30g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese"],"prepSteps":["1. To make the pâte à choux, heat the water, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a saucepan over medium heat just until the butter is melted. Dump in all the flour at once and stir the mixture briskly for about 2 minutes, until the dough forms a smooth ball. Remove from the heat and scrape the dough into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (If you don't have a stand mixer, simply leave it in the bowl.) Let the dough sit for 3 minutes, stirring it every so often to release some of the heat.","2. With the mixer on medium-high speed, add the eggs one at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the dry mustard and beat until the dough is completely smooth. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and set aside.","3. To make the mornay sauce, melt the butter in the saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, letting the mixture bubble, stirring constantly for 2 minutes, until the paste is thickened. (Don't let it brown.) Gradually whisk in the milk, beginning slowly and stirring constantly to avoid lumps.","4. Decrease the heat to low and cook the mornay for 6 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the sauce is about as thick as a milkshake. Remove from heat and add the salt, cayenne, and 1/2 cup (40g) of the Swiss-style grated cheese; stir until the cheese is melted.","5. Butter a shallow 2 1/2- to 3-quart (2.5 to 3l) baking dish. (A wide dish is preferable to a deep one for browning the cheese topping.) Sprinkle half of the Parmesan over the bottom and sides. Spread 1 cup (250ml) of the mornay sauce over the bottom of the baking dish.","6. Line a large dinner plate with a few layers of paper towels. Bring a pot of salted water to a low boil. Either using two soupspoons—one to scoop up some of the dough and the other to scrape it into the boiling water—or a spring-loaded ice cream scoop filled partially full, scoop a round of the dough—about 1 generous tablespoon each—and drop it into the water. (The ice cream scoop was a little newfangled for Paule, although she did agree—reluctantly—that it was more expedient and made nicer gnocchi.) Working in batches, poach 8 to 10 gnocchi at a time. Let them poach for 2 minutes, then retrieve them from the water and drain them on the paper towels. (They won't be fully cooked inside.) Repeat, poaching the rest of the gnocchi the same way.","7. Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) with the oven rack in the top third of the oven.","8. Once the gnocchi are parcooked, place them in a single layer on top of the mornay in the baking dish, and then spoon the rest of the mornay over the gnocchi in a fairly even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 1 1/4 cups (100g) of Swiss-style cheese over the top, along with the remaining Parmesan. Put the baking dish on a foil-covered baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 400ºF (200ºC) and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the cheese on top is well browned. Let cool a few minutes, and then serve in the baking dish, family style."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"54a41ebf6529d92b2c00738e","dek":"Mousse au Chocolat au Beurre Salé\nThere's not much I can say about this.

Spread the sugar evenly over the bottom of a wide saucepan. Heat the sugar over medium heat. As it begins to liquefy at the edges, use a heatproof spatula to very gently drag the liquefied sugar toward the center. Watch carefully, as once the edges start to darken, the sugar is in danger of burning. Continue to cook, stirring very gently, until all the sugar is melted and begins to caramelize.","2. When the caramel is a deep amber color and starts to smoke, wait for a moment for it to smell just slightly burnt, then remove it from the heat and quickly whisk the butter, stirring until melted. Gradually whisk in the cream and stir until the little bits of caramel are completely melted. (A few can be stubborn, so be patient. You can strain the mixture if they simply refuse to budge.)","3. Once smooth, add the chocolate, stirring gently until it's melted and smooth. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Once it's no longer warm, whisk in the egg yolks.","4. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff. Fold one-third of the whipped whites into the chocolate mixture, sprinkling in the flaky salt. Fold in the remaining beaten egg whites just until no streaks of white remain. Divide the mousse into serving glasses, or transfer it to a decorative serving bowl, and chill for at least 8 hours. While it might be tempting to serve this with whipped cream, I prefer to serve it pure, straight up with just a spoon."],"reviewsCount":7,"willMakeAgainPct":71}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:48:41.153Z","count":1944,"number":181,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=182&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=180&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
