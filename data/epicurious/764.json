note: This recipe is excerpted from The 2nd Avenue Deli Cookbook, by Sharon Lebewohl and Rena Bulkin.\nGefilte fish, today a prized delicacy, dates from the Middle Ages in Germany, where it was conceived as a fish stretcher — an ancient relative of Hamburger Helper. Religious Jews embraced it as a highlight of Friday-night dinners, because it solved a spiritual dilemma: though the Talmud suggests eating fish on Friday nights, it is forbidden (because it's considered work) to separate fish from bones on the Sabbath. We've found that most people who say they don't like gefilte fish have only tasted the supermarket variety, sold in jars, which is like saying you don't like filet mignon when you've only tasted beef jerky. Happily, preparing authentic gefilte fish from scratch is not an arcane skill possessed only by Jewish great-grandmothers. With today's food processors, it's not even especially difficult. Our recipe is sweet, in the Polish tradition; Russian gefilte fish is more peppery.","hed":"Gefilte Fish","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sharon Lebewohl"},{"name":" Rena Bulkin"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/gefilte-fish-234457","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.67,"ingredients":["1 (1 1/2-pound) fillet of whitefish and (1 1/2-pound) fillet of carp or pike (at fish store, ask for whole fish, filleted and skinned.

This is one of those dishes where organization is imperative. Because the oysters cook for only a few minutes, you've got to have the garnishes ready before you put the shells on the grill. The mango pico de gallo and the red chile horseradish are hot and sweet on your tongue. If you think that the red chile horseradish looks too spicy, don't worry, for the sweet mango provides just the right cooling sensation.

Prepare eight individual soufflé cups (1-cup capacity) with cooking spray. In a large bowl, toss the bread cubes with the berries to distribute evenly. In another bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk or electric mixer on low speed until frothy. Add the sugar and beat until well blended. Add the half and half, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg and continue beating on low speed until well blended. Fill soufflé cups with bread and berry mixture, mounding it a bit on top. Pour egg mixture over the bread and berries, filling evenly to the rim.","Place the soufflé cups in large ovenproof baking dish and pour boiling water into the dish until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the soufflé cups. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick placed in the center of the puddings comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to cool. These can be made one day ahead of the shower; simply refrigerate overnight and serve at room temperature. Just before serving, dust each top with powdered sugar."],"reviewsCount":16,"willMakeAgainPct":88},{"id":"54a4391819925f464b388f55","dek":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from The Dooky Chase Cookbook by Leah Chase and are part of our story on Mardi Gras.\nWhen I finished high school, and before I came to work in the laundry in New Orleans, I worked for a lady in Madisonville who had a boardinghouse. The place had only men — I always seem to be in places where there are only men — who worked at the shipyard and boarded at her place. They would come home at noon and we would have to cook lunch. She taught me how to cook a few things. There was another black girl working there so we used to laugh together because this woman cooked so different. She used to cook string beans and tell us that we needed to make a roux for these string beans. We would laugh and laugh.\nWe cooked on this great big wood stove. When we did make a roux, we would take the lid off of the stove to make it in a hurry over the open fire. Many times we burned the roux and would have to pour it in the fire.\nOne of the things I learned there was how to make a potato salad. The lady didn't put mayonnaise in — she used chicken fat. She raised her own chickens until they were six weeks old and then we killed them. We'd have to clean them and fry them. To make it easier, though, this recipe uses mayonnaise!","hed":"Potato Salad","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:55.000Z","author":[{"name":"Leah Chase"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/potato-salad-233900","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Cajun/Creole","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.69,"ingredients":["4 medium white potatoes","1 tsp. salt","1/2 tsp. white pepper","3 hard-boiled eggs (chopped)","1 cup chopped celery","1 tbsp. chopped parsley","1 tbsp. chopped dill pickles","1 tbsp. yellow mustard","1/2 cup mayonnaise","Lettuce leaf"],"prepSteps":["Boil potatoes in their jackets.
