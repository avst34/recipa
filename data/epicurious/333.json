In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the milk and cream to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, in a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or using a hand-held mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add 1/2 cup of the hot cream-milk mixture into the egg mixture. This will slowly bring up the temperature of the eggs so they won't curdle when you mix them with the rest of the hot cream.","2. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the cream-milk mixture and stir to combine. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 175°F on an instant-read thermometer (this is the point at which it will thicken noticeably), about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the salt and vanilla extract, and pour through a strainer into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.","3. Meanwhile, prepare the apples: In a skillet, stir the apples with 3 tablespoons water and the cinnamon over medium heat. Cook until the apples are tender and translucent, and the water has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a fork to mash the apples to the consistency of chunky applesauce. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate, covered, until you're ready to freeze the ice cream.","4. Once chilled, your ice cream base should register between 35°F and 40°F on an instant-read thermometer. If it doesn't, you can set the bowl over some ice and stir to quickly cool it. Stir the apples and gingersnaps into the ice cream base. Pour the mixture into an ice-cream maker, leaving an inch at the top to allow for expansion, and prepare according to the manufacturer's instructions.

My friend Kathy Cohen gets it exactly right—her bread, stuffed with apples, raisins, and cinnamon, is the highlight of her annual Jewish New Year feast. For years, I'd count the days between slices, until I finally decided to ask for the recipe.\nApple Notes: There aren't a lot of apples in this bread, so you want a variety that really stands out.

Combine 1/2 cup warm water, the yeast, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Stir until the yeast dissolves. Let it activate for 10 minutes—the mixture should look foamy.","2. In the large bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment or with a hand-held mixer, beat the eggs at medium speed until blended. Add the oil, salt, and remaining 3/4 cup sugar.

Spoon a bit of apple mixture down the center of each rectangle, then fold dough over the filling, roll into a 15-inch rope, and pinch the ends tight.","7. Form the loaves: Put three of the apple-filled \"ropes\" on each baking sheet. Braid the ropes together (fold right rope over center, then fold left rope over center, repeat). Pinch at bottom. Repeat with the other loaf. Cover the loaves with kitchen towels, and let rise for 45 minutes.","8. Preheat the oven to 400°F and set a rack to the middle position. Whisk the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush over the tops of the loaves.

One half of the pie was filled with pork and the other with apples. As I later learned, that dish has its roots in an eighteenth-century workingman's lunch called the Bedfordshire Clanger—a hand-held pie filled with meat on one end and jam on the other. It was a compact way to serve lunch and dessert in one package.\nIn adapting this idea to my own taste, I decided to layer apples on top of a spiced ground pork filling, rather than setting the two ingredients side by side. The flavors are fantastic together, and this dish has been the hit of many parties. It makes an especially good buffet option, as it can be served warm or at room temperature.\nApple Notes: As with all pie recipes, you want firm fruit here.

First make the crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sage, and salt until well combined. Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour mixture and use your fingers to work them in (you want to rub your thumb against your fingertips, smearing the butter as you do so). Do this until the mixture looks like cornmeal with some pea-sized bits of butter remaining. Stir in the cheese with a fork until evenly distributed. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and stir with a fork until the dough begins to come together. If needed, add an additional tablespoon or two of ice water (you shouldn't need much more). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead three times. Gather the dough into a ball, then divide into two portions, making one slightly bigger than the other. Press each portion down into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.","2. Make the filling: In a skillet over medium-low heat, cook the apples without any oil, stirring gently, until they just begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a dish and set aside. Add oil to the pan and increase the heat to medium-high. Add the onion, pork, brown sugar, salt, and spices. Cook, using a wooden spoon to break up the meat, until it is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let the meat mixture cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to a food processor. Add the breadcrumbs and pulse five times until the mixture has the texture of coarse sand. Set aside.","3. Prepare the crust: Unwrap the larger disk of dough and put it in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper or wax paper. Cover the dough with a second piece of parchment. Roll out, working from the center, to a 13-inch circle. Peel off the top piece of parchment and transfer the dough to a pie plate, peeled side down. Peel off the remaining parchment and press the crust into the sides of the pie plate, draping any excess over the edge. Unwrap the smaller disk of dough and put it in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper. Cover the dough with a second piece of parchment. Roll out, working from the center, to an 11-inch circle. Set aside.","4. Preheat the oven to 425°F and set a rack to the second-to-bottom position. Fill the pie: Pour the meat mixture into the bottom crust and gently smooth the top with a spatula. Arrange the cooked apple slices over the meat, pressing down to make the whole construction as smooth and neat as possible. Peel the top sheet of parchment off the top crust. Transfer, peeled side down, to the pie, then peel off the remaining parchment. Using a sharp knife, make two 3-inch slashes in the crust to allow steam to escape. Fold the edges of the bottom crust up over the top crust and crimp the edges to seal. Brush the crust with the egg wash and decorate with sage leaves, if desired. Bake at 425°F for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375°F and bake until the crust is golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes more.

Remove the green shoot inside, if there is one. Fill a small saucepan with cold water and add the garlic. Bring the water to a boil. When the water begins to boil lift the garlic out of the water and into a bowl of ice water to quickly cool it. Repeat this twice, always starting with cold water in the saucepan. Peel the onion and cut in half, then cut into large chunks. Peel the cucumber. Cut in half, then into large pieces. Halve the bell peppers, then remove the seeds and white membranes. Chop the bell peppers, then aside along with the cucumber and onion. Cut the tomatoes into large wedges and put in a bowl with the onions, cucumbers, and bell peppers. Add the bread, torn into pieces, then pour over the water. Process everything together using a hand-held blender, or using a food processor. Strain the gazpacho through a fine-mesh strainer. Add the oil, vinegar, and mayonnaise, then whisk or blend the soup until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Chill in the fridge before serving (at least 2 hours).
