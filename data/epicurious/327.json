It can be vegan, vegetarian, or made with meat—usually lamb. Some cooks add chickpeas, chicken gizzards, or broken-up bits of angel hair pasta. But the result is always unmistakably harira, and that's what makes it so comforting and satisfying.\nHarira has the inexplicable quality of being both light and filling at the same time, making you feel perfectly content. That's why, besides being the national soup, it's also a religious institution: it's what every family in Morocco eats to break their daily fast all through the monthlong observance of Ramadan. All over the country, for an entire month of sunsets, the first thing the entire population tastes is harira, and breaking the fast with anything else would be like serving Thanksgiving dinner without turkey.\nDuring Ramadan here in the States, I fast all day, even though I keep up my normal schedule, shopping in the farmers' market and working in the kitchen. As soon as the sun goes down, I step away from my expediting station and have a quick bowlful of harira to get me through the evening. And on days off, I take home a quart of it to break the fast at my house.\nThe first time you make this, try making a light meal of it, with just some bread and maybe a simple salad. You'll understand what I'm talking about. It's weirdly, wonderfully satisfying—in a way that fills your soul more than your stomach.\nI make harira with water, not stock, because I think this vegetarian (actually, vegan) version is lighter and cleaner tasting, but you can make it with chicken or lamb stock or half stock and half water. While its flavor is very true to the original, I've played with its preparation. For example, I cook the lentils separately, to keep them from breaking down too much. (My mom called that crazy, but she smiled when she tasted the result.) And if you cook them in the soup, they darken the cooking liquid and give the soup a muddy appearance. The yeast-and-flour mixture is my version of the traditional starter made from fermented flour and water, used exclusively for harira, that you'll find in every Moroccan kitchen. It's easier to manage but has the same effect as that sourdough original, thickening and lightening the soup, and keeping it from separating, while adding a rich, tangy flavor. I wanted to give people a little crunch without adding an extra element, so I took the celery out of its usual place in the sautéed soup base and reintroduced it at the end as a raw garnish.\nIn Morocco, harira is classically served with dates, which add sweetness to balance the soup's acidity. Taste it without the dates, and then try it with them. You'll find it's an entirely different experience. When I first started serving this soup at the restaurant, I'd accompany it with a few beautiful (and expensive) California Medjools on the side. The dates kept coming back uneaten. People just didn't get the idea of savory soup and sweet dates, which drove me nuts. So I thought of a way to work the dates into the soup, rolling them into little balls and adding them as a garnish. People get it now. The date balls are never left uneaten. They're a part of the bigger idea, as they should be.\nThis makes a big batch. That's how I always do it, even at home, because we love to eat it over several nights, and it keeps for up to a week.","hed":"Lentil Soup, Date Balls, Celery Salad","pubDate":"2011-11-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mourad Lahlou"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lentil-soup-date-balls-celery-salad-368811","photoData":{"id":"54b27f28a801766f773f769a","filename":"368811_lentil-soup_1x1.jpg","caption":"Lentil Soup, Date Balls, Celery Salad","credit":"Deborah Jones","promoTitle":"Lentil Soup, Date Balls, Celery Salad","title":"Lentil Soup, Date Balls, Celery Salad","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.5,"ingredients":["3 tablespoons (27 grams) kosher salt","1 tablespoon (7.6 grams) ground cumin","1 tablespoon (5.5 grams) ground coriander","1 teaspoon (2.6 grams) ground white pepper","1 1/2 teaspoons (4 grams) sweet paprika","1 teaspoon (2 grams) ground ginger","1/2 teaspoon (1.4 grams) ground turmeric","1/4 teaspoon (0.2 gram) saffron threads","2 cups (484 grams) tomato paste (not double concentrate)","8 quarts plus 1 cup (7.6 kilograms) cold water","2 bunches (8 ounces/224 grams) cilantro, leaves and tender stems only","1 bunch (4 ounces/112 grams) flat-leaf parsley, leaves and tender stems only","1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) yellow onions","Green leaves from 1 bunch celery, about 3 cups (35 grams); stalks reserved for garnish","1/3 cup (44 grams) all-purpose flour","2 cups (468 grams) warm water (about 110°F)","1/8 teaspoon (0.4 gram) active dry yeast (not quick-rising)","Kosher salt","3 tablespoons (45 grams) fresh lemon juice, or to taste","12 Medjool dates","Extra virgin olive oil","1 1/2 cups (288 grams) dried green lentils, preferably French, picked through and rinsed","Reserved bunch of celery (from above)","2 tablespoons (27 grams) extra virgin olive oil","2 tablespoons (8 grams) minced flat-leaf parsley","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",""],"prepSteps":["Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl.

He was an old salt, his arms deeply tanned and wrinkled from the sun, his beard scraggly and speckled with dried seawater. We asked what he had been catching. \"Skate,\" he replied. Not familiar with the fish, we inquired further and he told us, \"In New England we call skate poor mans scallops.\" He explained that \"back in the day,\" people on the cape would cut out rounds of the meat as a substitute for scallops because the species shared a common sweetness. What he didnt tell us is that skate is notoriously difficult to work with when whole.\nI learned that lesson the hard way and, at the same time, realized the true value of the fish. In the fall of 1999 I had a lot of free time on my hands. Annisa wasn't open yet and I was just learning the art of angling. Jen and I had driven all the way from Manhattan to Shinnecock Canal on Long Island because we heard that striper fishing was particularly good there. After a few hours, and a rough time of it, I landed my skate.\nI am by no means squeamish, but this fish broke me. None of my extensive culinary training prepared me for what followed. It was the skate that would not die. It took hours; multiple gashes in the head; a three-and-a-half-hour airless trunk ride from Long Island back home to Manhattan, and a drag-out struggle on the cutting board. We gave up the good fight and decided to let the skate die while we watched TV in the next room. Since that traumatic experience, I have not personally killed another skate, but its often on the menu at annisa. It is robust and, yes, sweet-flavored, but to call it \"poor mans scallop\" is inaccurate and doesnt do justice to the distinct character of the fish.","hed":"Sautéed Fillet of Skate with Caramelized Apples and Chicken Liver","pubDate":"2011-11-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Anita Lo"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sauteed-fillet-of-skate-with-caramelized-apples-and-chicken-liver-368810","photoData":{"id":"54b27ecca801766f773f74bc","filename":"368810_skate-_1x1.jpg","caption":"Saut&eacute;ed Fillet of Skate with Caramelized Apples and Chicken Liver","credit":"Lucy Schaeffer","promoTitle":"Saut&eacute;ed Fillet of Skate with Caramelized Apples and Chicken Liver","title":"Saut&eacute;ed Fillet of Skate with Caramelized Apples and Chicken Liver","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["4 1/2 tablespoons butter","1 onion, finely diced","3 tablespoons brandy","3/4 cup chicken stock","1/2 teaspoon salt","Black pepper to taste","2 1/2 tablespoons neutral-flavored vegetable oil","1 1/2 tablespoons butter","1 1/2 cup finely diced Granny Smith apples","2 1/2 tablespoons sugar","Pinch of salt","4 tablespoons neutral-flavored vegetable oil","1 tablespoon butter","6 ounces chicken livers, finely diced","4 (5 1/2-ounce) fillets skate","Salt and black pepper to taste","","Wondra flour","1 lemon, halved","1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives"],"prepSteps":["Heat a saucepan over high heat.

If it's not, then I want to try yours.\nI started paying attention to fried chicken in a serious way when I began work on the book Ad Hoc At Home. Ad Hoc is Thomas Keller's Napa Valley restaurant devoted to family meals. It offers one family meal each night, and everyone eats it. The fried chicken is so popular that it is served twice a week. Chefs Jeff Cerciello and Dave Cruz have tried all kinds of methods, mainly centering on the best crust. They decided that the trio of flour, buttermilk, and flour is best, and I agree. But the key here is the brine. Salt keeps the chicken juicy and seasoned, and also helps pull the rosemary deep into the flesh. So even after the rapture from eating the crust has passed, the flavor of the chicken holds you.\nThis brine, like all brines flavored with aromatics, is best when you bring the ingredients to a simmer in all the water. But if you're like me, sometimes you'll be caught short and need to hurry things along. If you have a scale, you can bring half the water to a simmer with the other brine ingredients, let the aromatics steep for 20 minutes. Measure the remaining water as ice and pour the brine over the ice. Or simply combine the brine with cold water.\nBecause so few people make fried chicken at home, I like to serve it to friends. Happily, it's a great do-head dish; the chicken will keep well for a couple of hours. You can fry it and then keep it on a rack in a 250°F/120°C/gas 1/2 oven until you need it. If you have a convection oven, use that feature to keep the crust crisp. The thighs will become delectably tender given the extra time in the low heat. Serve on a platter garnished with branches of deep-fried rosemary and grated lemon zest.","hed":"Rosemary-Brined, Buttermilk Fried Chicken","pubDate":"2011-11-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Michael Ruhlman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rosemary-brined-buttermilk-fried-chicken-368790","photoData":{"id":"54b27e739a93d64c380b00ea","filename":"368790_fried-chicken_1x1.jpg","caption":"Rosemary-Brined, Buttermilk Fried Chicken","credit":"Donna Turner Ruhlman","promoTitle":"Rosemary-Brined, Buttermilk Fried Chicken","title":"Rosemary-Brined, Buttermilk Fried Chicken","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.54,"ingredients":["1 small onion, thinly sliced","4 garlic cloves, smashed with the flat side of a knife","1 teaspoon vegetable oil","Kosher salt","5 or 6 branches rosemary, each 4 to 5 inches/10 to 12 centimeters long","4 1/2 cups/1 liter water","1 lemon, quartered","8 chicken legs, drumsticks and thighs separated","8 chicken wings, wing tips removed","3 cups/420 grams all-purpose/plain flour","3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper","2 tablespoons paprika","2 tablespoons fine sea salt","2 teaspoons cayenne pepper","2 tablespoons baking powder","2 cups/480 milliliters buttermilk","Oil for deep-frying"],"prepSteps":["In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, sauté the onion and garlic in the oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
