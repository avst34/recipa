A staple of the islanders' diet was the wild hog. The locals called the animals boucan, and that French word eventually came to be applied to many of the wild seafaring island men: buccaneers.\nBarbecue has become one of the world's favorite foods; few culinary subjects stir such rabid debate, from Texas to Memphis to South Carolina and on down to the Caribbean and South America. Barbecue as we have come to love it — using marinades and/or sauces and carefully slow-cooking — was perfected in the Caribbean. But some food scholars theorize that barbecue may have originated by accident in China many centuries ago, when a devastating fire burned down a barn, and the pig farmers, who had previously never cooked meat in a fiery fashion, smelled solace in their loss and as a consequence ate well that night. No less an authority on food than Waverly Root stated that cooking in this fashion was \"so natural under primitive circumstances that it would practically invent itself everywhere, especially in societies accustomed to living outdoors most of the time.\"\nIf you aren't familiar with country ribs, this recipe will introduce you to the cut, also known as split blade chops. You'll love them for all manner of dishes calling for pork ribs, barbecued or otherwise. This is a very easy recipe, though you need to allow the ribs to marinate overnight.","hed":"Chilean Country Ribs","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Norman Van Aken"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chilean-country-ribs-108203","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"technique","name":"Marinate","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.47,"ingredients":["3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped","1 jalapeño, stemmed, seeded, and roughly chopped","4 scallions, white and green parts, chopped","One 7-ounce can chipotle chiles in adobo sauce","3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh oregano","1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste","1 1/2 cups red wine vinegar","1 cup pure olive oil","4 pounds country pork ribs","Freshly ground black pepper to taste"],"prepSteps":["Combine the garlic, jalapeño, scallions, chipotles, oregano, and salt in a food processor and mix until relatively smooth.
