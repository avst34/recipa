Late at night I would sneak down into the kitchen and steal some of the dough, which tasted even better in its contraband form. In my professional cookie-making career, I have used my mother's nut horn dough to make countless cookies. It yields lovely Mexican wedding cookies, but it is especially good as a base for thumbprints.\nThe center of the thumbprint is a praline, which I cook on the stove as the cookies bake. While the cookies are still warm, I spoon the praline into the indentations and then chill the cookies until the centers have set. I buy toasted and salted pecans. If using unsalted nuts, add a pinch or two more salt. If the nut pieces are very large, run a knife through them before making the praline.","hed":"Pecan Praline Thumbprints","pubDate":"2015-04-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mindy Segal"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pecan-praline-thumbprints-56389460","photoData":{"id":"552d509920ca5d650ed244e4","filename":"56389460_pecan-praline-thumbprints_6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle","promoTitle":"","title":"56389460 pecan-praline-thumbprints","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cookies","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 3/4 cups (6 ounces) toasted, salted pecan pieces","3/4 cup granulated sugar","1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour","3/4 teaspoon kosher salt","3/4 teaspoon sea salt flakes","3/4 cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature","1/2 cup maple syrup","1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar","1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","1/2 teaspoon sea salt flakes","1/2 cup heavy cream","1 1/4 cups (4 1/2 ounces) toasted, salted pecan pieces"],"prepSteps":["In a food processor, pulse the pecans and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar until a fine meal forms but before the nuts start to release their oils.","In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter briefly on medium speed for 5 to 10 seconds.

Don't substitute a jumbo roaster—it will be too lean and won't tolerate high heat, which is the second requirement of the method. Small chickens, 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 pounds, flourish at high heat, roasting quickly and evenly, and, with lots of skin per ounce of meat, they are virtually designed to stay succulent. Your store may not promote this size for roasting, but let them know you'd like it. I used to ask for a whole fryer, but since many people don't want to cut up their own chickens for frying (or anything else), those smaller birds rarely make it to the display case intact; most are sacrificed to the \"parts\" market. But it is no secret that a whole fryer makes a great roaster—it's the size of bird favored for popular spit-roasted chickens to-go. It ought to return to retail cases.\nThe third requirement is salting the bird at least 24 hours in advance. This improves flavor, keeps it moist, and makes it tender. We don't bother trussing the chicken—I want as much skin as possible to blister and color. And we don't rub the chicken with extra fat, trusting its own skin to provide enough.\nBut if the chicken is about method, the bread salad is more about recipe. Sort of a scrappy extramural stuffing, it is a warm mix of crispy, tender, and chewy chunks of bread, a little slivered garlic and scallion, a scatter of currants and pine nuts, and a handful of greens, all moistened with vinaigrette and chicken drippings.","hed":"Zuni Roast Chicken with Bread Salad","pubDate":"2015-04-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Judy Rodgers"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/zuni-roast-chicken-with-bread-salad-56389456","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["One small chicken, 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 pounds","4 tender sprigs fresh thyme, marjoram, rosemary, or sage, about 1/2 inch long","Salt","About 1/4 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper","A little water","Generous 8 ounces slightly stale open-crumbed, chewy, peasant-style bread (not sourdough)","6 to 8 tablespoons mild-tasting olive oil","1 1/2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar","Salt and freshly cracked black pepper","","1 tablespoon dried currants","1 teaspoon red wine vinegar, or as needed","1 tablespoon warm water","2 tablespoons pine nuts","2 to 3 garlic cloves, slivered","1/4 cup slivered scallions (about 4 scallions), including a little of the green part","2 tablespoons lightly salted chicken stock or lightly salted water","A few handfuls of arugula, frisée, or red mustard greens, carefully washed and dried"],"prepSteps":["Remove and discard the lump of fat inside the chicken. Rinse the chicken and pat very dry inside and out. Be thorough—a wet chicken will spend too much time steaming before it begins to turn golden brown.","Approaching from the edge of the cavity, slide a finger under the skin of each of the breasts, making 2 little pockets. Now use the tip of your finger to gently loosen a pocket of skin on the outside of the thickest section of each thigh. Using your finger, shove an herb sprig into each of the 4 pockets.","Season the chicken liberally all over with salt and the pepper (we use 3/4 teaspoon sea salt per pound of chicken). Season the thick sections a little more heavily than the skinny ankles and wings. Sprinkle a little of the salt just inside the cavity, on the backbone, but don't otherwise worry about seasoning the inside. Twist and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders. Cover loosely and refrigerate.","Preheat the broiler. Cut the bread into a couple of large chunks. Carve off all of the bottom crust and most of the top and side crust (reserve the top and side crusts to use as croûtons in salads or soups). Brush the bread all over with olive oil. Broil very briefly, to crisp and lightly color the surface. Turn the bread chunks over and crisp the other side. Trim off any badly charred tips, then tear the chunks into a combination of irregular 2- to 3-inch wads, bite-sized bits, and fat crumbs. You should get about 4 cups.","Combine about 1/4 cup of the olive oil with the Champagne or white wine vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Toss about 1/4 cup of this tart vinaigrette with the torn bread in a wide salad bowl; the bread will be unevenly dressed. Taste one of the more saturated pieces. If it is bland, add a little salt and pepper and toss again. Place the currants in a small bowl and moisten with the red wine vinegar and warm water. Set aside.","Preheat the oven to 475°F. (Depending on the size, efficiency, and accuracy of your oven, and the size of your bird, you may need to adjust the heat to as high as 500°F or as low as 450°F during the course of roasting the chicken to get it to brown properly. If that proves to be the case, begin at that temperature the next time you roast a chicken. If you have a convection function on your oven, use it for the first 30 minutes; it will enhance browning, and may reduce overall cooking time by 5 to 10 minutes.)","Choose a shallow flameproof roasting pan or dish barely larger than the chicken, or use a 10-inch skillet with an all-metal handle. Preheat the pan over medium heat. Wipe the chicken dry and set it breast side up in the pan. It should sizzle. Place in the center of the oven and listen and watch for it to start sizzling and browning within 20 minutes. If it doesn't, raise the temperature progressively until it does. The skin should blister, but if the chicken begins to char, or the fat is smoking, reduce the temperature by 25 degrees. After about 30 minutes, turn the bird over (drying the bird and preheating the pan should keep the skin from sticking). Roast for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on size, then flip back over to recrisp the breast skin, another 5 to 10 minutes. Total oven time will be 45 minutes to an hour.","While the chicken is roasting, place the pine nuts in a small baking dish and set in the hot oven for a minute or two, just to warm through. Add them to the bowl of bread.","Place a spoonful of the olive oil in a small skillet, add the garlic and scallions, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until softened. Don't let them color. Scrape into the bread and fold to combine. Drain the plumped currants and fold in. Dribble the chicken stock or lightly salted water over the salad and fold again. Taste a few pieces of bread—a fairly saturated one and a dryish one. If it is bland, add salt, pepper, and/or a few drops of vinegar, then toss well. Since the basic character of bread salad depends on the bread you use, these adjustments can be essential. Pile the bread salad in a 1-quart baking dish and tent with foil; set the salad bowl aside. Place the salad in the oven after you flip the chicken the final time.","Remove the chicken from the oven and turn off the heat. Leave the bread salad to continue warming for another 5 minutes or so. Lift the chicken from the roasting pan and set on a plate. Carefully pour the clear fat from the roasting pan, leaving the lean drippings behind. Add about a tablespoon of water to the hot pan and swirl it. Slash the stretched skin between the thighs and breasts of the chicken, then tilt the bird and plate over the roasting pan to drain the juice into the drippings. Set the chicken in a warm spot (which may be your stovetop), and leave to rest while you finish the bread salad. The meat will become more tender and uniformly succulent as it cools.","Set a platter in the oven to warm for a minute or two. Tilt the roasting pan and skim the last of the fat. Place over medium-low heat, add any juice that has collected under the chicken, and bring to a simmer. Stir and scrape to soften any hard golden drippings. Taste—the juices will be extremely flavorful.","Tip the bread salad into the salad bowl.

It's an adaptation for the home kitchen of the much larger oval filone and the football-shaped pugliese sold at the Sullivan Street Bakery. I suggest you try this before any of the variations in Chapter Three, to get the hang of it. Even if you've baked before, the process is probably nothing like what your experience would lead you to expect. For one thing, many people who bake this bread find the dough to be unusually wet. Remember that most of the water is meant to be released as steam in the covered pot, and you'll be handling the dough very little anyway.\nDon't feel too uptight about any of this. For example, I specify that the dough should rise at room temperature, about 72 degrees Fahrenheit. (In many of the recipes, I say to put the dough in a warm, draft-free spot—same thing.) But if that's not what you have at the moment, you'll be okay anyway. Just pay attention to the visual cues: At the end of the first rise, the dough is properly fermented when it has developed a darkened appearance and bubbles, and long, thread-like strands cling to the bowl when it's moved. After the second, briefer, rise, the loaf has risen sufficiently if it holds the impression of your fingertip when you poke it lightly, making an indentation about 1/4 inch deep. It should hold that impression. If it springs back, let it rise for another 15 minutes.","hed":"No-Knead Bread","pubDate":"2015-04-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jim Lahey"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/no-knead-bread-56389453","photoData":{"id":"5526e1ea20ca5d650ed21408","filename":"56389453_basic-no-knead-bread_6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Squire Fox","promoTitle":"","title":"56389453 basic-no-knead-bread","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["3 cups (400 grams) bread flour","1 1/4 teaspoons (8 grams) table salt","1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) instant or other active dry yeast","1 1/3 cups (300 grams) cool water (55 to 65 degrees F)","Wheat bran, cornmeal, or additional flour, for dusting","A 4 1/2- to 5 1/2-quart heavy pot"],"prepSteps":["1. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until you have a wet, sticky dough, about 30 seconds. Make sure it's really sticky to the touch; if it's not, mix in another tablespoon or two of water. Cover the bowl with a plate, tea towel, or plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature (about 72 degrees F), out of direct sunlight, until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough is more than doubled in size. This will take a minimum of 12 hours and (my preference) up to 18 hours. This slow rise—fermentation—is the key to flavor.","2. When the first fermentation is complete, generously dust a work surface (a wooden or plastic cutting board is fine) with flour. Use a bowl scraper or rubber spatula to scrape the dough onto the board in one piece. When you begin to pull the dough away from the bowl, it will cling in long, thin strands (this is the developed gluten), and it will be quite loose and sticky—do not add more flour. Use lightly floured hands or a bowl scraper or spatula to lift the edges of the dough in toward the center. Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round.","3. Place a cotton or linen tea towel (not terry cloth, which tends to stick and may leave lint in the dough) or a large cloth napkin on your work surface and generously dust the cloth with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Use your hands or a bowl scraper or wooden spatula to gently lift the dough onto the towel, so it is seam side down. If the dough is tacky, dust the top lightly with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Fold the ends of the towel loosely over the dough to cover it and place it in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours. The dough is ready when it is almost doubled.
