We obtained this recipe from Rose Pistola restaurant in San Francisco, where they serve their own farinata.\nFarinata is a thin, crisp, pizzalike pancake made from chick-pea flour. When we called Rose Pistola, we were thrilled to learn that the recipe had already been reworked for the home cook by Peggy Knickerbocker, coauthor with chef Reed Hearon of The Rose Pistola Cookbook: 140 Recipes from San Francisco's Favorite North Beach Restaurant (out October, 1999 from Broadway Books).\nThe following recipe makes three farinata, but they must be baked one at a time. We suggest opening a bottle of wine, hanging out in the kitchen with friends, and eating the farinata as they come out of the oven.\nFor best results, use a 10-inch seasoned cast-iron round griddle, about 3/8-inch deep, that can hold about 1 cup batter. Farinata can be made in a regular cast-iron skillet, but it won't be quite as crisp or easy to remove.","hed":"Farinata with Sage, Olives, and Onion","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Peggy Knickerbocker "},{"name":" Reed Hearon"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/farinata-with-sage-olives-and-onion-102392","photoData":{"id":"5612e634f35fab51707e7efa","filename":"102392.jpg","caption":"Farinata with Sage, Olives, and Onion","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Farinata with Sage, Olives, and Onion","title":"Farinata with Sage, Olives, and Onion","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 cup chick-pea flour","2 cups cold water","1 1/4 teaspoons salt","4 1/2 tablespoons olive oil","1/2 large white onion, thinly sliced","30 Niçoise olives, pitted","45 small or 30 large fresh sage leaves"],"prepSteps":["At least 1 hour before making farinata, set a pizza stone on rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 550°F.","Whisk together chick-pea flour and water until smooth, then whisk in salt and 2 tablespoons of oil.
