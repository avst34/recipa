soup might just be this city's most overworked culinary icon—so much so that in restaurants of quality in Charleston, you can detect more than a few chefs assiduously avoiding it. But an expertly made she-crab soup is a rare pleasure at home, and should be a part of every cook's repertoire. When we were in our teenage years, the soup seemed extra special because it's seasoned with sherry and traditionally served with a cruet of the fortified wine, the latter to pass around the table in case you wanted to add an extra jolt.\nBut she-crab soup isn't about the sherry (and in fact, we've come to realize that too often the sherry overpowers the crab), it's about the roe; and we don't think we'd ever truly reckoned with how important that roe is—coupled with the freshest crab meat you can find, of course—until the recent spring day we picked and cleaned an entire bushel of crabs (eighty, give or take) in a sitting. Since female crabs with roe inside are most prevalent in the spring, we found crab roe inside many of the adult females, called \"sooks,\" as we cleaned them, after cooking. When you remove the carapace (or top shell) from the body of the crab, the crab roe—if it's there—will appear as a mass of bright orange in the middle of the body, and sometimes you may also find more roe tucked in the sharp left and right points of the carapace. The roe has an earthy-briny flavor, and adds a pale orange color to this soup. In our recipe, we blend it into the soup itself and also use a portion to garnish each bowl.\nIs it possible to buy crab roe alone? Unfortunately, no. So when we make this soup now, we buy picked crab meat and a half-dozen female crabs with roe from our local market. Any fish market that takes the time to sell hard-shell blue crabs will know how to spot a female with crab roe, because the roe makes the underside of the carapace appear light orange. It really is worth going to the trouble to find the real deal; you won't be disappointed!\nRegarding the sherry: recently we've taken to giving each guest his or her own shot glass full of fino sherry (one of the most delicate expressions of the fortified wine) to drink as a paired beverage, instead of sending a cruet around the table.","hed":"She-Crab Soup","pubDate":"2013-03-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Matt Lee "},{"name":" Ted Lee"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/she-crab-soup-51156820","photoData":{"id":"54b027b2cae54b670340f907","filename":"51156820_crab-soup_1x1.jpg","caption":"She-Crab Soup","credit":"Squire Fox","promoTitle":"She-Crab Soup","title":"She-Crab Soup","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["6 live hard-shell sooks (female blue crabs with roe)","1 tablespoon all-purpose flour","2 tablespoons unsalted butter","1 cup finely minced shallots (2 to 3 large)","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","","1 quart half-and-half","1 tablespoon plus 4 teaspoons dry sherry, preferably fino, plus more for serving","1 1/2 cups picked lump, backfin, or jumbo lump crab meat","Chopped fresh chives (optional)"],"prepSteps":["1 Bring a large pasta pot two-thirds full of water to a boil, and using tongs, transfer 2 of the crabs to the pot. Cook until their shells turn bright orange, about 3 minutes, then transfer the cooked crabs to a colander set in the sink and run cold water over them. Add the next 2 crabs to the pot and repeat until all the crabs have been cooked.","2 As each cooked crab becomes cool enough to handle, slip your thumb beneath the place on its underside where the cape of shell tapers to a point, and lift the bottom shell up, pulling the entire carapace off the body of the crab. Clean out and discard the spongy-feathery gills on the body. Carefully pick out any orange roe you may see inside the body, and reserve. Then snap one of the smaller legs off the body of the crab to use as a pick, to tease out any roe in the hollows of the carapace that taper to a sharp point, and reserve. Repeat with the remaining crabs until all the roe has been picked. Then split the crab bodies and legs, pick the meat from them, and add it to the rest of the picked crab meat.","3 Pour off all but 3 cups of the cooking water, and add the picked crab bodies, legs, and carapaces, then return to a boil. Let boil until reduced by a third, about 10 minutes, and strain the crab broth into a 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven.","4 Heat the broth over high heat until it simmers. Put the flour in a small bowl or ramekin, spoon 3 tablespoons of the hot broth into it, and whisk it to a smooth paste with a fork. Pour the remaining broth into a blender, add 1/4 cup of the crab roe, and liquefy until the roe is completely dissolved in the broth. With the blender running, add the flour paste to the broth.","5 Return the Dutch oven to the heat and melt the butter over medium-low heat until it's frothy. Add the shallot, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is soft, fragrant, and translucent, but not brown, about 4 minutes. Add the half-and-half, the broth mixture, and 1 tablespoon of the sherry, and cover. When the soup comes to a simmer, turn the heat to low, uncover, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the soup has reduced by about one-sixth, 12 to 15 minutes.","6 Add the crab meat and cook for 2 minutes over low heat, stirring to combine. Season the soup with salt and black pepper.","7 Pour a teaspoon of sherry into each bowl before serving, and garnish each bowl with about 11/2 teaspoons roe and chives, if using.

These crullers, one of my family's favorites, are the latter.\nNote: Undercooked crullers will collapse while cooling, so observe the first one and if this happens, increase your frying time (and check your oil temperature) for the rest.","hed":"French Crullers","pubDate":"2013-03-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lara Ferroni"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/french-crullers-51157200","photoData":{"id":"54b026ee766062b20344655e","filename":"51157200_french-crullers_1x1.jpg","caption":"French Crullers","credit":"Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"French Crullers","title":"French Crullers","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["1 cup water","6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter","2 teaspoons (10 grams) superfine sugar","1/4 teaspoon salt","1 cup (135 grams) all-purpose flour, sifted","3 large eggs, divided","1 to 2 egg whites, slightly beaten","Vegetable oil for frying","Basic Sugar Glaze"],"prepSteps":["1. Place the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a brisk boil over medium high heat. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is completely incorporated. Continue to cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes to steam away as much water as possible. The more moisture you can remove, the more eggs you can add later and the lighter your pastry will be. The mixture is ready when a thin film coats the bottom of the pan.","2. Move the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Although you can mix the pâte à choux by hand, this can be rather arduous, so use a mixer if you have one. Stir the mixture for about 1 minute to allow it to cool. Then mix on medium speed and add the first egg. Let it mix in completely and then scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining eggs, one at a time, and mix in completely. Add the egg whites, a little at a time, until the paste becomes smooth and glossy and will hold a slight peak when pinched with your fingers. Be careful not to add too much egg white or your crullers will become heavy. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star piping tip.","3. To fry the crullers, heat at least 2 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot until a deep-fat thermometer registers 370°F. While the oil is heating, cut out twelve 3-by-3-inch squares of parchment paper and lightly grease them. Pipe a ring onto each square. When the oil is hot, place one cruller at a time in the oil, paper side up. Remove the paper with tongs. Fry on each side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel for at least 1 minute. Once cool to the touch, the crullers can be glazed.","Crullers also bake very well, although they will have slightly firmer crusts than the fried versions. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pipe the crullers onto it, at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F and bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, open the oven door slightly and let the crullers sit in the cooling oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove, dip in glaze, and cool on a rack until the glaze has set.","Beignets, the classic New Orleans fried dough treats, use this same batter and are even easier to prepare. Simply drop rounded teaspoonfuls of the batter into the oil. As the dough puffs, the beignets will turn themselves over—but keep an eye on them and flip any that need a little help."],"reviewsCount":9,"willMakeAgainPct":63},{"id":"54a41f3b19925f464b377463","dek":"Ask any Southern baker: caramel cake can reduce a fully grown adult to tears—and we don't mean happy tears, either. It's the icing, a challenge that makes fiddly pastries seem like a walk in Washington Park. Caramel icing is made from little more than cooked sugar and milk, but when it comes time to spread it over the cake layers, it has to be just the right temperature—warm enough to be pourable, but cool enough that, when you work it around the cake with an icing spatula it sets in place. If the icing cools too fast, stiffening as you're spreading, you'll tear the beautiful cake layers, which are nigh impossible to repair. And if the icing dosn't cool fast enough, it will overflow the cake stand and onto the counter.\nStressed yet?\nFear not, because we have all you require here—namely, the right recipe with the right instructions so that you know that you're doing the right thing. And we also have some tips, care of our friend Angie Mosier, the Atlanta-based food stylist, writer, and photographer, also the baker of Ted and E.V.'s wedding cake.\nAccording to Angie, even accomplished Southern bakers will lay sheets of waxed paper around the cake stand to catch any too-warm icing that may overflow, so that it can be returned to the bowl to cool further (we prefer to ice the cake on a rack set over a sheet pan lined with wax paper). Angie reccomends having a small amount of hot water and an electric hand-mixer nearby as you ice the cake so that, if the icing seems to be cooling too readily and seizing up, you can quickly soften it by adding a teaspoonful of hot water to the bowl and blending it to loosen it up. And for those times when icing seizes on the cake before you've had a chance to spread it, keep a hair dryer nearby, too, for spot-heating cooled icing\nIf you're up to the challenge, this is truly a fun one, and succeeding is its own special achievement. As for the cake that results, that perfect salty caramel icing, with its burnt-sugar crispiness dissolving almost instantly on your tongue…it'll bring the happy tears","hed":"Caramel Cake","pubDate":"2013-03-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Matt Lee "},{"name":" Ted Lee"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/caramel-cake-51156830","photoData":{"id":"54b026d9766062b20344647c","filename":"51156830_caramel-cake_1x1.jpg","caption":"Caramel Cake","credit":"Squire Fox","promoTitle":"Caramel Cake","title":"Caramel Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.36,"ingredients":["1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pans","2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans","2 teaspoons baking powder","2 teaspoons salt","1/4 teaspoon baking soda","2 cups sugar","3 large eggs","2 large egg yolks","2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","3/4 cup whole milk","1 1/2 cups whole milk","4 cups sugar","10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) butter","2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste","1/4 teaspoon baking soda","1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract","Hot water"],"prepSteps":["1 Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour two round 9 by 2-inch cake pans. Pour about a tablespoon of flour into each of the pans and roll it around, tapping as you go, until the sides and bottom are covered completely with a thin layer of flour. Tip the pans, and tap out excess flour.","2 In a large mixing bowl, mix thoroughly with a whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.","3 In a separate large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until creamy, about 30 seconds. Add the sugar in 1/2-cup measures, beating about 15 seconds after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary, until the mixture has lightened in color and become fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, and the vanilla, beating for 15 seconds after each addition.","4 Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in thirds, alternating with additions of the milk. To avoid overmixing the batter, mix gently with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula after each addition, until the ingredient is just incorporated. Beat until all the ingredients have been incorporated, and then just a few strokes beyond. Divide the batter between the cake pans and spread the tops evenly.","5 Bake until a cake tester or toothpick emerges clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in their pans on a rack for 10 minutes, then slide a thin paring knife around the edge of the pans, and invert the cakes. Turn each cake again so its rounded top is facing up, and cool the cakes completely on the rack.","6 Make the icing: Pour the milk and 3 cups of the sugar into a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, mixing with a whisk. Add the butter and the salt, whisking occasionally until the butter melts. When mixture just simmers, cut the heat, but keep over the warm burner.","7 Pour the remaining 1 cup sugar into a saucepan. Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until it becomes a syrup, stirring every so often with a wooden spoon as it begins to brown, until the sugar syrup is evenly amber colored, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour the syrup into the warm milk mixture, being very careful, as the caramel will bubble and sputter when it hits the hot milk. Turn the heat beneath the pot to high and, whisking gently until all the syrup has completely dissolved into the roiling milk mixture, continue to cook to the soft-ball stage, about 238°F; this may take 8 to 12 minutes.","8 Cut the heat beneath the caramel and gently whisk in the vanilla and the baking soda. Dip a spoon into the caramel, and let it cool to taste it. Season the caramel to taste with salt, and pour it into the bowl of a standing mixer (or use an electric hand-mixer and a large bowl). Beat on low speed as it cools, 15 to 20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen, until the icing is creamy and thick (between 100°F and 105°F). Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, until the icing is between 95°F and 98°F—it should fall off your spatula in a ribbon that remains discernible on the surface of the icing for 10 seconds.","9 Set the first cake layer on a rack set over a sheet plan lined with waxed paper. Have an electric hand-mixer and the hot water nearby to blend a teaspoon or two into the icing if it becomes too thick to spread. Pour enough of the icing over the cake to cover the top in a layer about 1/4 inch thick (if it drips over the edge in places, that's fine; this is an early test of whether it's going to set in place or not). Top the first cake with the second cake layer and pour the rest of the icing in stages over the top of the cake, letting it run down the sides and using an icing spatula to guide the icing around the cake as it drips, until the entire cake is covered, for a traditional, classic look. (If you prefer the dramatic look of cake layers peeking out from behind a curtain of icing drips, by all means choose that route!) If you need to reuse any icing that overflows into the pan, simply move the cake on its rack temporarily, scrape up the icing from the waxed paper with a spatula and return it to the bowl, replace the rack over the pan, and continue to ice the cake.","10 Once the icing has set, using two spatulas carefully transfer the cake from the rack to a cake stand and let stand at room temperature beneath a cake dome until ready to serve. Only refrigerate if you plan to store the cake for more than 2 days."],"reviewsCount":5,"willMakeAgainPct":75},{"id":"54a41f376529d92b2c007720","dek":"Editor's Note: This recipe goes with Daniel Humm and Will Guidara's Manhattan Clam Chowder .","hed":"Chicken Stock","pubDate":"2013-03-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Daniel Humm "},{"name":" Will Guidara"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chicken-stock-51157410","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["10 pounds chicken backs and necks","15 pounds ice cubes","1 cup diced leek, white part only","1/2 cup diced celery","1/2 cup diced celery root","1/2 cup sliced shallot","1/2 cup diced fennel","5 white peppercorns","1 bay leaf","1 sprig thyme"],"prepSteps":["Rinse the chicken backs and necks well under running water for 5 minutes.

You pick them up by the stem end and eat the whole thing, minus the stem, that is.","You can probably do fancier, cheffy things with them, but they're terrific like this. For variety, I sometimes use a little toasted sesame oil instead of olive oil and finish them with togarashi. If you have leftovers, an unlikely event in my experience, chop off the stems and put the peppers in an omelet or some scrambled eggs."],"reviewsCount":14,"willMakeAgainPct":93},{"id":"54a41f3d6529d92b2c007758","dek":"Faced with a cup of just-shucked peas, my mind runs in a million directions. Should I simmer them with soft butter lettuce leaves, pair them with pasta, or flatter their delicacy with new sage leaves and their blossoms, fresh mint, or lemon (or even all three)? Basil is lovely with peas, too. I could add them to that meager handful of fava beans that are waiting for company, or use them to make a frothy green soup. After scanning the possibilities, I end up cooking them with minced shallot, sage, and lemon, then spooning them over baked ricotta with crispy bread crumbs. This is one of my favorite dishes.","hed":"Peas with Baked Ricotta and Bread Crumbs","pubDate":"2013-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Deborah Madison"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/peas-with-baked-ricotta-and-bread-crumbs-51153200","photoData":{"id":"54b02706766062b203446629","filename":"51153200_peas_1x1.jpg","caption":"Peas with Baked Ricotta and Bread Crumbs","credit":"Christopher Hirsheimer and Melissa Hamilton &copy; 2013","promoTitle":"Peas with Baked Ricotta and Bread Crumbs","title":"Peas with Baked Ricotta and Bread Crumbs","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Cheese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.6,"ingredients":["Olive oil","1 cup high-quality ricotta cheese, such as hand-dipped full-fat ricotta","2 to 3 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs","4 teaspoons butter","2 large shallots or 1/2 small onion, finely diced (about 1/3 cup)","5 small sage leaves, minced (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)","1 1/2 pounds pod peas, shucked (about 1 cup)","Grated zest of 1 lemon","Sea salt and freshly ground pepper","","Chunk of Parmesan cheese, for grating"],"prepSteps":["Heat the oven to 375°F.
