Turn off immediately and let the milk steep with the vanilla beans for 30 minutes. Whisk the yolks until smooth and slowly temper your hot-milk mixture into them, whisking continuously. Immediately pour the cream into the mix and put into an ice bath until cool.","With a standing mixer or by hand, mix the peanut butter and honey together until homogenous. Reserve 1/2 cup of this mix to be heated and served as a sauce with the pudding.","Place sliced bread in a 8x10 Pyrex or metal pan that has been lined with a piece of parchment paper to cover bottom of pan.

Finish with a final layer of bread and press down firmly on the top of the bread to make sure that the pudding is totally \"together.\" Pour 8 cups of the custard over the top of the pudding as follows: To ensure that the entire pudding gets saturated, poke holes with a knife or a wooden skewer through the top of the pudding. Pour 2 cups of the custard on top and let that soak in for 10 minutes. Then pour 2 more cups, allow it to soak in, and repeat process until all the custard has been used.

Place the pudding into a water bath so that the water reaches halfway up the side of the pan.
