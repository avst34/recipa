This version is based on the recipe in Das Grosse Sacher Backbuch (\"The Big Sacher Baking Cook\"), which should be a reliable source.\nDon't expect the cake layer to look perfect; sometimes the air bubbles are large and make holes in the top of the cake.

To make the torte: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400°F. Lightly butter a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or wax paper.

Rather than seasoning the beans while they're cooking, which keeps them from softening, you season them after they've cooked and then give them time to absorb the salt and garlic. Ideally, this recipe should be made a day or so ahead of time to let the flavors develop even further.\nAlot of people use parsley as a \"default herb\" to garnish a dish without really thinking about whether another herb might work better. But the flavor of parsley here truly matters; it completes the balance of the salad.","hed":"Chickpea-Carrot Salad","pubDate":"2009-03-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bill Telepan "},{"name":" Andrew Friedman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chickpea-carrot-salad-352409","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.3,"ingredients":["One 1-pound bag dried chickpeas, soaked overnight in cold water to cover","1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes","2 quarts vegetable stock or water","Salt","1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice","2 tablespoons red wine vinegar","3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil","2 cups grated carrots (from 2 large or 4 medium carrots)","1 cup red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice","1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley","1 teaspoon minced garlic"],"prepSteps":["1.
