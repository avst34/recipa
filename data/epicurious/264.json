The seasoned butter on this bird is a bright and herbal mix of chopped sage leaves and fresh orange and lemon zest, which bathes the breast with the essence of the Thanksgiving aroma.\nFor the all-important gravy, we offer two homemade options for stock, as well as store-bought chicken broth. We can't rave enough about the gravy made from the brown turkey stock. Trust us when we say it produces the most soul-satisfying sauce, and because it's not dependent on the giblets from your turkey, it can be made weeks ahead and frozen.\nIf you're hosting a smaller group for Thanksgiving this year, such as a group of four, or perhaps even just the two of you, we suggest forgoing the whole bird for a turkey breast with the same prep.\nEditor's Note: This recipe is part of our Gourmet Modern Menu for Thanksgiving for 2 or 20. Menu also includes: Roasted Butternut Squash Ribbons with Arugula, Pancetta, and Hazelnut Salad; Mashed Potato and Cauliflower Gratin; Cabernet-Cranberry Sauce with Figs; Challah, Sausage, and Dried Cherry Stuffing; and for dessert, Apple Crostata with Spiced Caramel Sauce .","hed":"Citrus-Sage Roast Turkey with Gravy: Large Crowd","pubDate":"2012-11-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/citrus-sage-roast-turkey-with-gravy-large-crowd-51137800","photoData":{"id":"560aa4216a59cdb91b601842","filename":"51137800_citrus-sage-roast-turkey-lg.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"","title":"51137800 Citrus-Sage Roast Turkey with Gravy: Large Crowd","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"turkey","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 (13- to 15-pound) turkey at room temperature 1 hour, any feathers and quills removed with tweezers or needle-nose pliers, and neck and giblets removed and reserved for giblet stock or another use if desired","1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, well softened","1/4 cup finely chopped fresh sage leaves","1 teaspoon grated lemon zest","Salt","Freshly ground black pepper","1 navel orange","1 medium red onion, cut into wedges","3 to 4 cups brown turkey stock, giblet stock, or low-sodium chicken broth","1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter","6 tablespoons all-purpose flour","Salt","Freshly ground black pepper","2 small metal skewers; kitchen string; large flameproof roasting pan (not glass) with a flat rack; instant-read thermometer; 2-quart glass measure"],"prepSteps":["Heat oven to 425°F with rack in lowest position.

Better yet, the summer roll is a big win for the health-conscious because the roll is almost fat-free, and the sauce, while sporting a little peanut butter, is not highly caloric. One dipped bite yields an explosion of flavors and textures that's guaranteed to excite any palate.\nEditor's Note: This recipe is part of Gourmet's Modern Menu for Fiery Fare.

I couldn't eat it for years, having been force-fed it at primary school aged six, with tinned jam, as it oozed like frogspawn out of the bowl and I wept and retched. For years I had the same malicious feeling toward beets and mashed potatoes, which were instant and came in lumpy granules. My teacher and I had a silent war every lunchtime; a war that eventually came to an end after my parents removed me from the school. Made to your own wont, in your own kitchen, tapioca is ambrosial, and worth being a grown-up for, as is semolina.
