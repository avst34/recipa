Countries such as the Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania each have their own version, sometimes chilled, sometimes served as a warm porridge. (The dish used to be a tradition in Russia as well, but because of the communist Soviet Union's official atheism, it has become extinct there.)\nOur version is based on the baked Ukrainian style, which is traditionally made with wheat berries, which require overnight soaking and long cooking. For convenience, we've substituted quick-cooking barley, which packs the same nutty-chewy punch. For the best results, prepare the pudding a day ahead: Let it cool, cover it, and chill it overnight to let the flavors meld. Serve it chilled, plain or sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar.","hed":"Ukrainian Grain Pudding","pubDate":"2006-11-16T18:50:19.000Z","author":[{"name":" Tracey Seaman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ukrainian-grain-pudding-236736","photoData":{"id":"560dd7f9f3a00aeb2f1d295e","filename":"236736.jpg","caption":"Ukrainian Grain Pudding","credit":"Chris Astley; food styling: Tracey Seaman","promoTitle":"Ukrainian Grain Pudding","title":"Ukrainian Grain Pudding","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Eastern European/Russian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups pearl barley","3/4 cup poppy seeds","1/2 cup sliced almonds","1/2 cup honey","1/2 teaspoon salt","7 dried apricots, thinly sliced","1/2 cup raisins","1/4 cup sugar, optional","1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, optional"],"prepSteps":["In medium saucepan over high heat, combine barley and 5 cups water.

For many Norwegians, and members of Norwegian communities such as those in the Midwestern United States, making lefse symbolizes the start of the Christmas season. They can be either sweet or savory: On the Christmas Eve buffet, they often accompany lutefisk (preserved cod) and pork ribs, but as a snack, they're popular rolled up, spread with butter, and sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar.\nLefse are traditionally made using special grooved rolling pins; large, superheated griddles; and long wooden spatulas. However, we found that a regular rolling pin, a 10-inch cast iron skillet, a pastry bench scraper, and a thin metal spatula worked just fine. Cooking the potatoes thoroughly and using a ricer or food mill will ensure that there will be no lumps in the potato dough.","hed":"Norwegian Flatbreads","pubDate":"2006-11-16T18:40:59.000Z","author":[{"name":" Tracey Seaman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/norwegian-flatbreads-236734","photoData":{"id":"560dd7f97b55306961bfabb3","filename":"236734.jpg","caption":"Norwegian Flatbreads","credit":"Chris Astley; food styling: Tracey Seaman","promoTitle":"Norwegian Flatbreads","title":"Norwegian Flatbreads","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Scandinavian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["4 medium-large russet potatoes (about 2 pounds), finely diced","5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch slices","1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt","1/2 cup heavy cream","2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour","1/2 cup sugar","1 teaspoon cinnamon","About 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour","4 tablespoons salted butter, melted"],"prepSteps":["In medium saucepan over high heat, combine potatoes and cold water to cover.
