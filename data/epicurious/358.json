It's a bit of a stretch, but they could be described as a (very) distant cousin of arancini, Italy's beloved deep-fried risotto balls. In contrast, these are pan-fried in a touch of oil, and smushed flat in the pan to get as much surface browning and crust as possible.

One of the most refreshing I've discovered to date is panakam, typically made during the Hindi festival Sri Rama Navami. If you can imagine a frosty cold, light, bright ginger beer, you'll have an idea of its taste. I make my version sparkling, and because the traditional jaggery is sometimes hard to come by (and slow to dissolve), I use whatever full-flavored, fine-grain, natural cane sugar I have on hand—muscovado works nicely. This version is also dialed back as far as sweetness goes; some versions I've come across use double or even triple the amount of sugar.
