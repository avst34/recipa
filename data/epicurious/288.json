You can either deep-fry or toast the pita croutons that give the salad its special character; the fried bread will taste better, but toasted is, obviously, healthier. When tomatoes are out of season, I like to substitute cherry or grape tomatoes since they're likely to be juicier and more flavorful. If you can find purslane, use it (a cup or two, chopped); it adds authenticity and a nice peppery bite.","hed":"Fattoush","pubDate":"2012-06-18T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Salma Abdelnour"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/fattoush-51105800","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Middle Eastern","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["3 small pita breads","1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying (optional)","2 tomatoes, diced (or 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved)","1 large or two small cucumbers, diced","1 cup scallions, chopped","1 cup green bell pepper, diced","3 radishes, thinly sliced in semicircles","1 romaine lettuce head, torn into small pieces","3/4 cup parsley, chopped","1 1/2 cups olive oil","1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice","6 cloves garlic, crushed","1/2 cup sumac","1 cup fresh mint, chopped","salt and pepper to taste"],"prepSteps":["1.
