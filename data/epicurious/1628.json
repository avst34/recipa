Sprinkle 4 tortillas with both cheeses and hominy, dividing equally; top with remaining 4 tortillas. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium heat. Place 2 quesadillas in each skillet. Cook until bottoms are crisp and brown, pressing occasionally with spatula, about 2 minutes. Turn quesadillas over. Cook until bottoms are brown and cheeses melt, adding more oil as needed, about 2 minutes longer. Cut quesadillas into quarters. Arrange 4 quarters on each of 4 plates. Serve with salsa."],"reviewsCount":9,"willMakeAgainPct":89},{"id":"54a44f776529d92b2c01df51","dek":"The jalapeño-flavored butter is also good with chicken or fish, or even corn on the cob.","hed":"Watercress Sandwiches with Chili-Lime Butter","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/watercress-sandwiches-with-chili-lime-butter-106637","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.17,"ingredients":["1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature","1/4 cup minced seeded jalapeño chilies","1 tablespoon fresh lime juice","2 teaspoons grated lime peel","8 thin slices whole grain bread","1 bunch watercress, thick stems trimmed"],"prepSteps":["Mix first 4 ingredients in small bowl to blend.
