Grease three 18cm (7 inch) cake tins and line with parchment paper.","Put the butter, sugars, flour, baking powder, malt powder and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low until all the butter is rubbed into the dry mixture and it has a sandy texture. Alternatively, rub the butter into the dry ingredients by hand, as if you were making pastry.","In a small jug, beat together the milk, eggs and vanilla. Pour the mixture down the side of the bowl into the dry ingredients and beat until everything is mixed together. When all the liquid has been added, beat on a high speed for two minutes until it is well combined and smooth. Alternatively, you could use an electric hand-held whisk.","Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and bake in the preheated oven for 25–30 minutes until golden brown. The cake will look slightly darker than you might expect with the added malted milk powder, so be more vigilant in checking that it is ready.","Heat the milk and malted milk powder in a small saucepan. Whisk until all the lumps of powder have dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly. Set aside to cool. Beat the butter in a large bowl until smooth, then gradually add the icing sugar and cool malted milk paste. Use an electric hand-held whisk to beat the buttercream for 5–10 minutes until light and fluffy. It should hold its shape but still be fairly soft.","To assemble the cake, stack the bottom two layers on top of each other and use a circular 9cm cutter to remove the middle. Press through both layers at once to make sure the holes line up.","Put the bottom ring on a cake stand and cover the top with a layer of buttercream using a palette knife. Try not to get icing too close to the middle, because moisture on the sweets will cause them to become sticky.","Put the second ring on top of the first and fill the hole with milk bottle sweets. Make sure it is filled to the same level as the sponge or the top sponge will cave in. Cover the second ring with buttercream then add the final sponge. Thinly cover the whole cake with some of the buttercream to trap any crumbs, then chill for a minimum of 30 minutes.","Cover the cake with the remaining buttercream, placing a large dollop on the top to create a swirl.

Place the rice in a deep bowl and pour in enough cool tap water just to cover the grains. Using your fingertips in gentle swirling, swishing motions, rinse the grains for about 15 seconds. With slightly scooping motions, gently lift the grains once or twice, to ensure that water flows freely around each grain. Drain the rice. Use your hand or a fine-mesh strainer to hold back the rice as you drain off the water. Some people find it useful to line their strainer with fine-woven cloth (the Japanese use sarashi) or a clean, low-lint kitchen towel. Carefully transfer the rice to a pot or rice-cooker bowl.","Place the washed and drained rice in a sturdy, straight-sided pot. A 2- or 3-quart size will work well for the two smaller quantities, and a 4- to 6-quart pot is appropriate for the larger amount. Add the water. Ideally, the rice should sit in its measured water for 10 minutes before cooking, but if you are pressed for time, add a few extra drops of water and cook right away. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.","Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. You will hear bubbling noises and see the lid begin to dance after several minutes. An onomatopoeic folk jingle that describes the cooking of rice refers to this bubbling stage as choro choro. Reduce the heat and continue to cook until the water is absorbed (about 5 minutes). You will know this point has been reached when you hear a low hissing sound (the folk jingle calls this naka pappa). If it is difficult to rely on the sound of the cooking and you must check visually on progress along the way, peek quickly, replacing the lid immediately.","Increase the heat to high again for 30 seconds to dry off the rice. Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice stand, still tightly covered, for at least 10 minutes. Even if you wish to serve the rice piping hot, these final minutes of self-steaming (called murasu) are necessary to achieve the proper texture.","Place the washed and drained rice in the bowl of your cooker. Add the water. It is important to use cool liquid when cooking rice in a thermostatically controlled appliance; using warm or hot liquid from the start will cut short the cooking cycle. Close the lid, press the start switch, and let the appliance do the cooking. The time required to complete the cooking cycle will vary with the appliance, but most models take about 40 minutes to cook 1 to 1 1/2 cups raw rice."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"5954233ad52ca90dc28200e7","dek":"Spread this easy compound butter on waffles, pancakes, and French toast for sure, but it's also great on a ham and cheese sandwich.","hed":"Maple Butter","pubDate":"2017-06-01T14:57:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Daniel Shumski"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/maple-butter","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"meal","name":"Breakfast","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, at room temperature","1 tablespoon maple syrup"],"prepSteps":["Combine the ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whip with an electric mixer or a whisk until well blended."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"594171cf12c27b1823808238","dek":"This savory, addictive dressing will taste good on just about anything, including cold noodle salads.","hed":"Sesame-Ginger Dressing","pubDate":"2017-06-01T14:46:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Claire Saffitz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sesame-ginger-dressing","photoData":{"id":"59417337a76fcc25997a351a","filename":"ramen-with-steak-and-sesame-ginger-dressing.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Alex Lau","promoTitle":"","title":"ramen-with-steak-and-sesame-ginger-dressing.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"Bon Appétit","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice","2 tablespoons soy sauce","2 tablespoons tahini","1 1/2 teaspoons sugar","1 teaspoon finely grated peeled ginger","1 garlic clove, finely grated","1/2 cup vegetable oil","1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil"],"prepSteps":["Whisk lemon juice, soy sauce, tahini, sugar, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl to combine.
