Wash rice three times in the cold water in the pot by rubbing it between your hands. Drain well after washing. Add 15 ounces water to the rice and allow it to rest for 1 hour before cooking. I prefer that so-called old rice be used — rice that has been lying about in sacks for extended periods, for it will absorb water better and will cook easier. (It is often suggested that a ratio of 2 cups of rice to 2 cups of water be used. This is unsatisfactory because it will be too soft.)","Begin cooking the rice, uncovered, over high heat, by bringing the water to a boil. Stir the rice with the wooden spoon or chopsticks and cook about 4 minutes or until the water is absorbed, or evaporates. Even after the water is gone, the rice will continue to be quite hard. Cover the pot and cook over very low heat for about 8 minutes more, stirring the rice from time to time.","Turn off the heat and loosen the rice with the wooden spoon or chopsticks. This will help it retain its fluffiness. Cover tightly until ready to serve. Just before serving, stir and loosen the rice once again. Well-cooked rice will have absorbed the water but will not be lumpy, nor will the kernels stick together. They will be firm and separate. The rice may be kept hot in a warm oven for an hour without drying out."],"reviewsCount":6,"willMakeAgainPct":80},{"id":"54a42c9619925f464b380622","dek":"Wake up your taste buds with this lowfat recipe.

The characteristically red (devil) brown color of the cake comes from the baking soda, an alkali that reddens chocolate as it neutralizes some of its acidity and leavens the cake. This recipe is specifically developed for use with natural, not Dutch-process, cocoa. Because cocoa packs and clumps in its container, you will get the most accurate measurement if you first sift it onto wax paper, then spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off.\nYou can bake this cake as two layers, fill it with your favorite fruit preserves (try black cherry or raspberry), and frost it with the Mocha Buttercream Icing.

The pumpkin and oil keep the cake fresh even in high, dry mountain air. Topped with a white icing glaze and walnuts, it makes a gala presentation, and at every altitude it won high praise from taste-testers of all ages.\nIf you want a vanilla-flavored glaze, add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; for a maple flavor, add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon maple extract.","hed":"Porterfield Pumpkin Bundt with Snow White Glaze","pubDate":"2008-12-12T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Susan G.
