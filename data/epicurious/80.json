In this recipe, the kimchi and assorted quick-pickled vegetables are the dominant flavors, making a bright-tasting, tangy bowl. Pickling chard stems is a great way to use them up—they’ll add bits of celery-like crunch, and using rainbow chard means lots of extra color, too. Furthermore, the pickled components and the sautéed chard both keep well, meaning that they can be made in advance or packed up as good leftovers.

Poke holes all over sweet potatoes and wrap each in foil. Place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast until potatoes are tender, 60–70 minutes (if you have one, use a cake tester to poke right through foil). Unwrap and let sit until cool enough to handle. Increase oven temperature to 450°F. Meanwhile, combine chile, honey, and butter in a small saucepan; season with salt. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring to combine. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar.","Smash sweet potatoes with your palm, then tear into bite-sized pieces (including skin), the more irregular, the better. Place in a large bowl and add half of hot honey (do not include chile as it will burn); season with salt. Arrange pieces, skin side down, in a single layer on an unlined rimmed baking sheet and roast until browned and crisp around the edges, 20–25 minutes. Drizzle with remaining hot honey with chile."],"reviewsCount":2,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"56e86fdf8bbed20d21934900","dek":"If you feel like experimenting, try using cashews or pecans in place of the almonds.","hed":"Iced Horchata Latte","pubDate":"2016-03-01T21:28:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/iced-horchata-latte","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"Bon Appétit","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1/4 cup brown rice","2 tablespoons coffee beans","1/4 cup raw almonds","1/2 cinnamon stick, crushed","1/4 cup sugar","Pinch of kosher salt","A spice mill or coffee grinder"],"prepSteps":["Using a spice mill or coffee grinder, coarsely grind rice and transfer to a 2-qt. airtight container.
