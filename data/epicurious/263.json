I simply put the cauliflower in a 2 1/2-quart microwave-safe casserole deep enough to accommodate it, one with a tight-fitting domed lid. I then center the covered casserole in my microwave oven, set the cook-time at 14 minutes, and hit HIGH (full power). My microwave oven is a 650-watter; newer models of higher wattage will do the job faster—perhaps twice as fast. But you will know your particular model's prowess better than I. If you choose to steam the cauliflower instead, allow 8 to 10 minutes in a covered saucepan over moderate heat or until crisp-tender—there should be about 3/4 inch of water in the pan.

A quick online search turned up this shocker. Eli N. Evans, my across-the-hall Gramercy Park co-op neighbor for nearly 20 years, is an aficionado of Atlanta Brisket. Who knew? President Emeritus of The Charles H. Revson Foundation of New York and like me a born-and-bred Tar Heel, Eli is the author of three acclaimed books: The Provincials: A Personal History of Jews in the South, Judah P. Benjamin: The Jewish Confederate, and The Lonely Days Were Sundays: Reflections of a Jewish Southerner. The irony here is that I'd hand recipe \"tests\" across the hall to Eli and his family, never dreaming that he knew a thing about cooking.","hed":"Atlanta Brisket","pubDate":"2012-12-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jean Anderson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/atlanta-brisket-51139200","photoData":{"id":"54b0389d766062b20344a7d5","filename":"51139200_brisket_1x1.jpg","caption":"Atlanta Brisket","credit":"Jason Wyche","promoTitle":"Atlanta Brisket","title":"Atlanta Brisket","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Beef","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.65,"ingredients":["5 pounds fresh beef brisket, trimmed of excess fat","2 bottles (16.5 ounces each) Coca-Cola (not Diet Coke)","1 teaspoon kosher salt","1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","3 tablespoons vegetable oil","2 cups Coca-Cola marinade, reserved from above","1 envelope dry onion soup mix (from a 2-ounce package)","1 can (8 ounces) salt-free tomato sauce","1/2 cup tomato ketchup","3 large yellow onions, halved lengthwise and each half sliced about 3/8 inch thick","3 large whole bay leaves (preferably fresh)"],"prepSteps":["1. Place brisket in large nonreactive roaster with snug-fitting lid (I used one measuring 15 1/2 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 4 inches deep). Pour Coca-Cola evenly over brisket, cover, and refrigerate 24 hours, turning brisket once or twice in Coca-Cola marinade.","2. When ready to proceed, preheat oven to 325°F. Lift brisket from roaster and pat dry. Line large fine sieve with coffee filter and set over medium-size bowl. Pour in Coca-Cola marinade and let drip through.","3. Rub brisket well on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in very large (15-inch) heavy skillet about 1 minute over high heat until ripples appear on pan bottom. Add brisket and brown 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Return brisket to roaster, now rinsed and dried.","4. For Gravy: Combine 2 cups filtered Coca-Cola marinade, soup mix, tomato sauce, and ketchup and pour over brisket. Scatter sliced onions on top and drop in bay leaves. Note: If you use fresh bay leaves, crinkle them a bit as you drop them into the roaster to release their flavor.","5. Cover roaster, slide into lower third of oven, and braise brisket 4 hours. Check roaster at half time and if liquid seems skimpy—not likely—add a little more filtered Coca-Cola marinade, or beef broth, or water.","6. Remove roaster from oven and set on trivet on counter. Remove lid and cool brisket at least 30 minutes to allow juices to settle and meat to firm up. Note: Some cooks bring the brisket to room temperature before serving. Discard bay leaves and remaining Coca-Cola marinade.","7. To serve, lift brisket to cutting board and slice about 1/4 inch thick—across the grain and slightly on the bias. Overlap brisket slices on large platter and smother with pan gravy and onions. The best accompaniment? For me nothing beats a tart and creamy coleslaw."],"reviewsCount":21,"willMakeAgainPct":56},{"id":"54a427256529d92b2c00c739","dek":"Southerners are especially clever about using up breads, raisins, and other dried fruits going stale. This frugal bread pudding—elegant enough for a party—is a case in point. The bread to use is firm-textured white bread (a.k.a. farm-style bread). I think raisin bread would be equally delicious though I've never tried it. And if I do, I'll omit the raisins or use half the amount called for. Tip: Only top-quality bourbon or sour mash whiskey will do for the sauce. Cheap brands lack flavor.","hed":"Favorite Bread and Butter Pudding with Bourbon Sauce","pubDate":"2012-12-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jean Anderson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/favorite-bread-and-butter-pudding-with-bourbon-sauce-51139210","photoData":{"id":"54b0386acae54b6703412c36","filename":"51139210_bread-pudding_1x1.jpg","caption":"Favorite Bread and Butter Pudding with Bourbon Sauce","credit":"Jason Wyche","promoTitle":"Favorite Bread and Butter Pudding with Bourbon Sauce","title":"Favorite Bread and Butter Pudding with Bourbon Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Bourbon","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["4 stale slices firm-textured white bread, crusts and all (see headnote)","2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened","1/2 cup dark seedless raisins (see headnote)","3 large eggs, lightly beaten","1/3 cup granulated sugar","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","1 1/4 cups milk","1 cup half-and-half","1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar","1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch","1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","1/4 teaspoon salt","1 cup water","1/3 cup bourbon (see Tip above)","2 tablespoons unsalted butter","1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"],"prepSteps":["1.

A sweet and frothy fruit milkshake, it's as varied as the currently available fruits in season. Guanabana, mamey, atemoya, coconut, cherimoya, banana, tamarind and many others—all contributing their gorgeous colors and enticing fragrances! Put the pulp of any tropical fruit or fruits in an electric blender with a little ice, a splash of milk and hit the blend button. Moments later, in a frosty glass, a delicious, healthy, delectable fruit smoothy is waiting for you. The buttermilk is my own addition. If you like the tangyness of sour cream ice cream or crème fraîche you will like this as well. If not, you can omit the buttermilk and go the standard batido route. It's all good.","hed":"Mamey Milkshake","pubDate":"2012-12-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Norman Van Aken"},{"name":" Justin Van Aken"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/mamey-milkshake-51138600","photoData":{"id":"57a9fd429a774aa934b6f09b","filename":"mamey-milkshake-080916.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Penny De Los Santos","promoTitle":"","title":"Mamey Milkshake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Smoothie","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 cup peeled, pitted and cubed fresh ripe mamey","1 cup milk","1/4 cup buttermilk","1/4 cup sugar or honey","1 dash pure vanilla extract (optional)","1/2 cup ice cubes"],"prepSteps":["Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.
