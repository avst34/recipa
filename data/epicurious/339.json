If you are a fan of creamed spinach, there is no way you won't fall head over heels for this dish.

Changing the leafy green from spinach to kale is a seemingly small substitute with a big impact. Like spinach, kale is packed with nutrients, but unlike spinach, it doesn't melt into the sauce; its texture is sturdier and retains its body when cooked.

About forty minutes north of Santa Fe, the highway cuts a paved path through Ohkay Owingeh, a Native American reservation, and the roadside becomes dense with fast-food outlets, outposts of national grocery chains, Walmart, and billboards for Ohkay Casino, Hutch and Norma Naranjo's sprawling midcentury home is set about fifty years back from the road, a shrine to the tug-of-war between new ways and traditional ones. In the backyward Mr. Naranjo built two hornos (behive-shaped adobe ovens). Inside the house, a handmade wreath of dried chiles hangs on one wall and a string of made-for-tourists ceramic peppers on another. A naïve painting of St. Francis hangs not far from a cluster of the dream catchers that the couple and their two grown children fashion from string, feathers, and yarn, just as their Pueblo ancestors did.\n\"We go to church one Sunday and dance the traditional dances the next,\" said Mrs. Naranjo. A retired social worker, she gives cooking classes and does a little catering. But she spends most of her mornings working the two-acre minifarm where she grows vegetables from seeds that have been passed from one Pueblo generation to another for at least a thousand years. \"The history of our people is in those seeds,\" she says. In the evenings, when her husband builds hornos on the terraces of hotels and McMansions, Mrs. Naranjo visits the elderly women in Ohkay Owingeh, who remember life and cooking when it was closer to the land, and collects their recipes and food stories. \"Our history lives in our hands as well,\" she says.\nMrs. Naranjo moves with the efficiency of a modern professional as she smooths cornmeal paste on damp cornhusks. Tiny white kernels from several ears of heirloom corn, and diced green chiles and squash, along with a thick, bloodred chile sauce and shredded fresh cheese, are lined up in small stainless-steel bowls at the head of her tamale assembly line. She notes that tamales were stuffed with rabbit, venison, pork—whatever people had. Vegetable tamales were a fine way to make use of the gardens' overflowing crops.\nShe swathes the dough, sprinkles filling, folds, ties, and places the tamale bundles on a rack set over water in a big enameled pot. From time to time, she glances out the window to the backyard, where her husband is feeding small, dry sticks into this new four-by-four horno. Her smaller tamales are, she says, her only concession to modernity: \"People love the little ones as snacks, and Hutch and I love them in these green chile stews we make in the horno.\"","hed":"Norma Naranjo's Tamales","pubDate":"2011-08-24T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Molly O'Neill"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/norma-naranjos-tamales-367329","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["One 8-ounce package dried corn husks, approximately 48 individual husks","3 cups masa harina (preferably Maseca brand)","6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, softened","1/4 vegetable oil or fresh lard","3/4 teaspoon kosher salt","1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder","About 1 1/2 cups warm water","1 teaspoon vegetable oil","3 cups diced peeled calabaza, zucchini, or summer squash, in 1/2-inch pieces","1 cup Red Chile Sauce","2 cups fresh chico corn kernels or other small, sweet corn kernels","4 to 6 roasted green chiles (canned or fresh), seeded and thinly sliced into 2-inch-long strips","2 cups shredded mozzarella or other fresh mild cheese"],"prepSteps":["1.

If necessary, anchor the crow to the cupcake with a small piece of toothpick. Using a pastry bag or parchment paper cone fitted with a fine plain piping tip, pipe red Royal Icing eyes onto the crow. Use a craft knife to score crow footprints on the fondant. Place the Maggots in the raspberry jam. Repeat to decorate the remaining cupcakes."],"reviewsCount":1,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a428dd6529d92b2c00dc30","dek":"","hed":"Dark Chocolate Ganache","pubDate":"2011-08-18T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Zilly Rosen"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/dark-chocolate-ganache-367229","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["2 3/4 cups mini semisweet chocolate chips","2 cups heavy cream","1 tsp unsalted butter"],"prepSteps":["1 Put the chocolate chips in a large heatproof bowl.

Roll the green Half and Half into 12 balls and then roll and press one end of each ball to thin it out into a cylinder shape. Flatten the rounded end so that the piece of frosting vaguely resembles a Ping-Pong paddle.","2 Using a craft knife, make one cut on one side of the flattened area to make a thumb. Pull it out to the side. Make a second cut in the middle of the remaining rounded portion, and a third and fourth cut on either side to create 4 fingers.","3 Pull and mold the tips of the fingers to make them slightly pointed. Using a toothpick, score 3 lines into each finger to create joints. This will be the palm side of the hand. On the reverse side, use the toothpick to indent a fingernail shape at the end of each finger.","4 Bend the fingers up from the palm to resemble a claw. Prop the hand against a vertical surface so that it dries in the claw shape. Make another 11 hands in the same way and let dry overnight.","5 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 12-hole muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners. Crush the Oreo cookies into 1/4-inch pieces. Spoon 1 tablespoon spoon into each liner, reserving the remaining pieces.","6 Melt the chocolate in a microwave oven on low, stirring every 15 seconds, or in a  heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and let cool. Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together and set aside. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and, using an electric mixer, beat together until pale and fluffy. Blend in the melted chocolate and then gradually beat in the eggs and mix well together. Mix in the vanilla extract and sour cream. Add half the flour mixture and blend in, then mix in the water and remaining flour mixture until incorporated.","7 Spoon half the batter into the paper liners and spread over the cookies. Add 1 heaping teaspoon of chocolate chips to each. Add the remaining batter and sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips and cookie pieces over the tops. Bake for about 25 minutes, turning once halfway through baking, until well risen and firm to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.","8 When the cupcakes are cool, spread or pipe the Dark Chocolate Ganache on top of each cupcake. Mix together most of the chocolate cookie crumbs and all of the chocolate chips in a dish and dip the top of each cupcake into the mixture to create graveyard earth.","9 Push a toothpick into the wrist end of each hand and press into the earth to anchor it. To enhance the effect of the hand rising from the grave, paint clear piping gel in different places on the hand and at the base, and sprinkle the remaining chocolate cookie crumbs on the gel so that it sticks.
