There is nothing like dining under the shade of a gourd tree on Christmas Eve, savoring every morsel of the earthy tamales called pasteles and adobo-flavored pork while looking at the sea.\nPuerto Rican women get together with their families to prepare pasteles by the hundred, freezing them until needed for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, family reunions, the Fiesta de Reyes, and the religious season called octavas that follows the Feast of the Epiphany.\nIt is the blend of the tiny pepper ají dulce and broad-leaf culantro in the fragrant sofrito (cooking sauce) that gives an unmistakable Puerto Rican identity to these earthy tamales. A dash of vinegar lends the sofrito just the right amount of tang against the mild dough of malanga and plantain tinted orange-yellow with achiote-infused lard.\nI learned to make these in the traditional kitchen of the Puerto Rican side of my family. While one person took care of trimming the plantain leaves, others were busy grating the vegetables and making the sofrito. There the vegetables are grated by hand, though you can find machines designed specially for this purpose in any market or use a food processor. Puerto Ricans are extremely fussy about the wrapping—it has to be perfect and watertight because pasteles are normally boiled. But I prefer to steam them.","hed":"Puerto Rican Pasteles (Pasteles Puertorriqueños)","pubDate":"2013-10-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Maricel Presilla"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/puerto-rican-pasteles-em-pasteles-puertorriquenos-em-51203630","photoData":{"id":"5603473cc301a9f945efdfe0","filename":"51203630_hires.jpg","caption":"Puerto Rican Pasteles (Pasteles Puertorriqueños)","credit":"Gentl & Hyers","promoTitle":"Puerto Rican Pasteles (Pasteles Puertorriqueños)","title":"Puerto Rican Pasteles (Pasteles Puertorriqueños)","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Central American/Caribbean","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.75,"ingredients":["6 large tomatoes (about 3 pounds), coarsely chopped","1 medium green bell pepper (about 6 ounces), cored, seeded, deveined, and coarsely chopped","1 medium yellow onion (about 8 ounces), coarsely chopped","8 garlic cloves, peeled","20 Caribbean sweet peppers (ajíes dulces), seeded and cut in half","1/2 cup tomato sauce","1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro","2 broad-leaf culantro leaves","1 1/2 tablespoons cider vinegar","1 teaspoon dried oregano","1/4 cup achiote-infused extra-virgin olive oil","8 ounces slab bacon, rind removed, cut into 1/4-inch dice","1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder or butt, cut into 1/2-inch dice","1/4 cup chicken broth","1/3 cup whole milk","1 1/2 pounds malanga, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes","1 1/2 pounds green bananas, peeled and thickly sliced","1/2 green plantain, peeled (see Cooks' notes) and thickly sliced","8 ounces calabaza (West Indian pumpkin) or Hubbard or kabocha squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes","1/4 cup achiote-infused extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste","Twenty-five 12-inch plantain leaf squares (4 to 5 packages; see Cooks' notes for how to prepare)","1/4 cup achiote-infused extra-virgin olive oil","Twenty-five 42-inch pieces of kitchen twine","1/3 cup dark raisins","One 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed, or 2 cups cooked chickpeas","2 medium red bell peppers (about 6 ounces), roasted (see Cooks' notes), peeled, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips","50 pimiento-stuffed olives, cut in half"],"prepSteps":["Place all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree.

It's often hard to come up with a dessert that pairs well with wine, but this savory-sweet dessert does. At its center is a Seckel pear, a small, reddish pear with a slightly spicy flavor. It has a firm flesh that makes it perfect for poaching. In this dessert I poach the pears in pomegranate juice with some ground black pepper. A chunk of Cabrales cheese, a strong blue cheese from northern Spain, is sandwiched between the top and bottom halves of the pear, and a Szechuan Ice Cream is served with it, sitting on a diamond of baked almond cream.","hed":"Poached Seckel Pear with Pomegranate, Cabrales Cheese, and Szechuan Pepper Ice Cream","pubDate":"2013-10-29T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Francois Payard"},{"name":" Tish Boyle"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/poached-seckel-pear-with-pomegranate-cabrales-cheese-and-szechuan-pepper-ice-cream-51202610","photoData":{"id":"56034737c301a9f945efdfd4","filename":"51202610.jpg","caption":"Poached Seckel Pear with Pomegranate, Cabrales Cheese, and Szechuan Pepper Ice Cream","credit":"Rogerio Voltan","promoTitle":"Poached Seckel Pear with Pomegranate, Cabrales Cheese, and Szechuan Pepper Ice Cream","title":"Poached Seckel Pear with Pomegranate, Cabrales Cheese, and Szechuan Pepper Ice Cream","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Ice Cream Machine","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["3 cups (750 g/26.4 oz) whole milk","1 cup plus 1 Tbsp (250 g/8.8 oz) heavy cream","3 Tbsp plus 1 tsp (20 g/0.7 oz) Szechuan peppercorns","8 1/2 large (160 g/5.6 oz) egg yolks","3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp (180 g/6.3 oz) granulated sugar","4 cups (1 kg/2.2 lb) pomegranate juice","3 to 5 turns freshly ground black pepper","8 Seckel pears, peeled (you will core them after they are poached)","2 cups (500 g/17.6 oz) poaching liquid from Poached Pears with Pomegranate","8 3/4 Tbsp (125 g/4.4 oz) unsalted butter","1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp (125 g/4.4 oz) granulated sugar","1 1/3 cups (125 g/4.4 oz) almond flour","2 large (100 g/3.5 oz) eggs","1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp (10 g/0.35 oz) all-purpose flour","4 oz (113 g) Cabrales cheese, cut into eight 1/2-inch-thick slices","ice cream machine; pepper mill; 9-inch square baking pan; 2-inch-long by 1-inchwide diamond-shaped pastry cutter"],"prepSteps":["1.
