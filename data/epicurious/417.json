I make gnocchi with ricotta cheese, not potatoes as you might expect. My grandmother taught me how to make them this way, and though they are less forgiving than potato gnocchi, I love their soft, delicate texture and flavor. They practically melt in your mouth. It's crucial to find high-quality ricotta cheese from a good Italian market, cheese shop, or gourmet store and then drain it, and to handle the gnocchi gently.

To prepare the gnocchi, gently mix the cheese, egg yolks, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl until blended.","2. Using your hands, fold the flour gradually into the cheese mixture. You may need more or less flour, depending on how well the cheese was drained. Work the dough until it forms a loose ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll each one into a long rope about 3/4 inch in diameter. Lightly dust each rope with flour to prevent sticking when you cut them into gnocchi.","3.

Although we'd never claim to have the \"definitive version,\" Miss Lewis and I worked together on this recipe until we got just what we wanted: an all-cornmeal bread that's light, moist, and rich, full of corn flavor, with the tanginess of sour milk or buttermilk. Like all Southern cornbreads, it has no sugar—that's a Yankee thing. Traditionally, milk that had started to culture was used in cornbread and other baked goods, both for its pleasant sharp taste and for a leavening boost (its acids react with baking soda to generate carbon dioxide). Since modern pasteurized milk doesn't sour nicely—it just goes bad—we use commercial buttermilk here instead. This is a genuine all-purpose cornbread, delicious as a savory bread or even as a dessert, slathered with butter and honey. My mother and grandmother only made this kind of leavened cornbread (which they called \"egg bread\") for cornbread stuffing, and it does make superb stuffing. It's also delicious in a time-honored Southern snack: cornbread crumbled into a bowl with cold milk or buttermilk poured over. Many Southerners—especially of an older generation—would call that a perfect light supper on a hot summer day, after a big midday meal.","hed":"Our Favorite Sour Milk Cornbread","pubDate":"2010-03-29T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Edna Lewis"},{"name":" Scott Peacock"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/our-favorite-sour-milk-cornbread-358343","photoData":{"id":"56098edee0acd286555d3789","filename":"358343.jpg","caption":"Our Favorite Sour Milk Cornbread","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Our Favorite Sour Milk Cornbread","title":"Our Favorite Sour Milk Cornbread","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.83,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups fine-ground white cornmeal","1 teaspoon salt","1 teaspoon Homemade Baking Powder (see note)","1 3/4 cups soured milk or buttermilk","2 eggs, lightly beaten","2 tablespoons unsalted butter"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 450°","Mix the cornmeal, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl.
