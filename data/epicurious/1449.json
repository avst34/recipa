Five of these blessings are over vegetables — apples (candied or dipped in sugar or honey), leeks, beet greens or spinach, dates, and zucchini or squash. These blessings symbolize their hopes for the New Year. Many of these Jews trace their ancestors back to Spain, which is called Sepharad in the Bible. Over the centuries, the Sephardic Jews took advantage of the abundance of vegetables available in the Mediterranean countries, often throughout the year. Among these vegetables are sweet potatoes and squash, great favorites of my family. The special blessing you can say over your sweet potatoes and squash at the beginning of your Rosh Hashanah dinner goes like this:\nYehi ratzon mi-le-faneha Adonai Eloheinu ve-lo-hei avoteinu she-tik-rah ro-a gezar dinenu ve-yi-karehu lefa-neha za-hee-yo-teinu.\nMay it be thy will, Lord our God and God of our fathers, that you should tear up any evil decree and let only our merits be read before You.","hed":"Sort of Sephardic Sweet Potatoes and Squash","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Nathan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sort-of-sephardic-sweet-potatoes-and-squash-40001","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.23,"ingredients":["1 pound acorn or butternut squash","1 pound sweet potatoes or yams","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","1/4 cup dried cranberries or cherries","2 tablespoons brown sugar","1 teaspoon ground cinnamon","Vegetable peeler","Sharp paring knife","Wooden spoon","Frying pan","Mixing bowl","Aluminum foil","Oblong casserole dish (about 9 by 13 inches)"],"prepSteps":["Adult: Preheat oven to 375°.
