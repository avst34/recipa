Spread a mounded teaspoon of the cheese mixture lengthwise down the middle of each eggplant slice, leaving a 1-inch border at the wide end, and, beginning at the narrow end, roll up the eggplant jelly-roll fashion. Arrange the rolls, seam sides down, in an oiled flameproof shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them in one layer and broil them for 3 minutes, or until the cheese is just melted and bubbling.","Transfer the eggplant rolls with a spatula to serving plates, spoon the tomato sauce over them, and garnish the rolls with the basil leaves. Makes about 12 rolls."],"reviewsCount":45,"willMakeAgainPct":91}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:51:03.105Z","count":1944,"number":1320,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1321&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1319&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
