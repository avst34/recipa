In the morning, it's dabo—honey bread—that graces the Ethiopian breakfast table. Unlike the pancakelike injera, dabo is a European-style loaf that is typically slathered with shiro, a chickpea spread. It highlights one of the distinctive characteristics of Ethiopian cooking: sweeteners are very rarely used, but an element of sweetness is introduced through other means, such as sugary coffees and teas; tej, a syrupy honey wine; or this dense breakfast bread, which lends a gentle sweetness to the start of the day.","hed":"Honey Bread","pubDate":"2009-07-23T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marcus Samuelsson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/honey-bread-354650","photoData":{"id":"5609a60462fa7a9917c259ec","filename":"354650.jpg","caption":"Honey Bread","credit":"Gediyon Kifle","promoTitle":"Honey Bread","title":"Honey Bread","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.12,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon chopped rosemary","1/4 cup canola oil","2 packets active dry yeast (1 1/2 tablespoons)","2 1/2 cups warm water","7 cups all-purpose flour","1 tablespoon salt","3/4 cup honey"],"prepSteps":["Toast the rosemary in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
