My version of that game would be pretty boring: a bunch of gin cards, the occasional dry vermouth card, and a die that just says \"olive\" or \"twist\" on all sides. Not a fun game, but these ingredients do make a superior cocktail in my opinion!\nSo I'm not big on martini variations, but this one minor twist on the classic martini simply adds a bit more herbal and savory character to the aromatics already present in the gin—a little more depth of character without going overboard. This cocktail will be best with a London dry–style gin. Some newer and small–batch gins—much as I love them—can have distinctive character that may or may not meld well with the rosemary.

Unfortunately, when many Americans think of sardines, they picture tiny fish drowned in oil, or some other saucy mixture, packed side by side in a small, flat can. But fresh sardines are a wonderful fish, nothing like their canned counterparts. Typically 5 to 6 inches in length, their flesh has a quite delicate flavor. If you can find them, sardines imported from Portugal have the best flavor.\nBecause of their small size, it is easiest to leave on the skin of sardines—it also imparts a great flavor. That said, remember that it is extremely important to wash the sardines very well, rinsing off all their scales under cold water. Scoring the skin will allow the fish to more easily soak up the flavorful marinade. Don't marinade the sardines for any longer than 2 hours or they will become mushy and pasty. Just enjoy them as soon as they're done marinating, with a silky dollop of crème fraîche or sour cream.","hed":"Whole Sardines with Fresh Herbs and Crème Fraîche","pubDate":"2010-07-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Douglas Rodriguez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/whole-sardines-with-fresh-herbs-and-creme-fraiche-360169","photoData":{"id":"56098efd6a59cdb91b5f787e","filename":"360169_hires.jpg","caption":"Whole Sardines with Fresh Herbs and Crème Fraîche","credit":"Copyright &copy; 2003 by Christopher Hirsheimer","promoTitle":"Whole Sardines with Fresh Herbs and Crème Fraîche","title":"Whole Sardines with Fresh Herbs and Crème Fraîche","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["4 pounds fresh sardines, cleaned, boned, and filleted","1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice","2 tablespoons salt","10 cloves garlic, thinly sliced crosswise","6 shallots, thinly sliced","1/2 cup virgin olive oil","Leaves from 6 sprigs thyme","Leaves from 6 sprigs oregano","1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice","1 tablespoon honey","1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper","1 cup crème fraîche or sour cream for garnish"],"prepSteps":["Lightly score each sardine crosswise on the skin side, three times per fillet.

As you eat the marinated fish, pull away bites of sweet potato from the edge of the dish and enjoy both components at once.
