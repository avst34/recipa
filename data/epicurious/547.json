remember exactly when I first encountered these celestial biscuits. It was in the early 1970s as I prowled the South in search of great grassroots cooks to feature in a new series I was writing for Family Circle magazine. Through country home demonstration agents, I obtained the names of local women who'd won prizes at the county and state fairs. I then interviewed two or three of them in each area before choosing my subject. And all, it seemed, couldn't stop talking about \"this fantastic new biscuit recipe\" that was all the rage—something called Angel Biscuits. The local cookbooks I perused also featured Angel Biscuits, often two or three versions of them in a single volume. Later, when I began researching my American Century Cookbook, I vowed to learn the origin of these feathery biscuits. My friend Jeanne Voltz, for years the Women's Day food editor, thought that Angel Biscuits descended from an old Alabama recipe called Riz Biscuits, which she remembered from her childhood. Helen Moore, a freelance food columnist living near Charlotte, North Carolina, told me that a home economics professor of hers at Winthrop College in South Carolina had given her the Angel Biscuits recipe back in the 1950s. \"I remember her saying, 'I've got a wonderful new biscuit recipe. It's got yeast in it.'\" Others I've queried insist that Angel Biscuits were created at one of the fine southern flour millers; some say at White Lily, others at Martha White (and both are old Nashville companies). In addition to the soft flour used to make them, Angel Biscuits owe their airiness to three leavenings: yeast, baking powder, and baking soda. Small wonder they're also called \"bride's biscuits.\" They are virtually foolproof.","hed":"Angel Biscuits","pubDate":"2008-10-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jean Anderson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/angel-biscuits-350535","photoData":{"id":"560d7942f9a841923089d8a5","filename":"350535.jpg","caption":"Angel Biscuits","credit":"Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"Angel Biscuits","title":"Angel Biscuits","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.27,"ingredients":["5 cups sifted all-purpose flour (preferably a fine southern flour; see headnote)","1 tablespoon baking powder","1 teaspoon baking soda","1/4 cup sugar","2 teaspoons salt","1 cup firmly packed vegetable shortening or lard or a half-and-half mixture of the two","2 cups buttermilk","One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup very warm water (105° to 115° F.)"],"prepSteps":["1.

This recipe, my own, combines three southern favorites: green beans, mustard, and country ham. I like these beans best with roast turkey, grilled or roast chicken. But they're equally delicious with pork chops or roast pork. Some southern supermarkets sell biscuit slices, slim rounds of country ham ready to cook and slip into biscuits. Others sell country ham by the piece or the pound. If it's not available in your area, you can order it from thevirginiacompany.com. Note: Because of the saltiness of the ham, the mustard, and the broth, these beans are unlikely to need additional salt.

There are several theories as to how these pies came by their name. Some say that \"chess\" is a corruption of chest, meaning that these pies were so rich they could be stored in chests at room temperature. Others offer a different explanation: It seems that long ago when a good plantation cook was asked what she was making, she replied, \"Jes pie,\" which over time became \"chess.\" Still others insist that \"chess\" derives from cheese, as in the English lemon \"cheese\" (or curd). According to food historian Karen Hess, \"cheese\" was spelled \"chese\" in seventeenth-century England. In her historical notes and commentaries for the 1984 facsimile edition of Mary Randolphs Virginia House-wife (1824), Hess writes: \"Since the archaic spellings of cheese often had but one 'e' we have the answer to the riddle of the name of that southern favorite Chess Pie.' \"\nWhen I lived in New York, I baked dozens of lemon chess pies for the annual Gramercy Park fund-raiser and they sold as fast as I could unpack them. From that experience, I learned to buzz up the filling in the food processor. I even grate the lemon zest by processor. Heres how: Strip the zest from the lemons with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, then churn it with the sugar to just the right texture. I next pulse in the lemon juice, then the eggs one by one. Finally, I drizzle the melted butter down the feed tube with the motor running. Thats all there is to it.","hed":"Lemon Chess Pie","pubDate":"2008-10-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jean Anderson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lemon-chess-pie-350518","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"meal","name":"Dessert","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.94,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups sugar","Finely grated zest of 3 large lemons","Juice of 3 large lemons","5 large eggs","1/3 cup butter, melted","One 9-inch unbaked pie shell (see About Pie Crusts, below)"],"prepSteps":["1.
