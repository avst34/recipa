note: Lisa Loeb shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. To read more about Lisa and get a peek inside her kitchen, see our Celebrity Kitchen Tour videos.\nThese are Lisa Loeb's favorite cookies, a version of Mark Bittman's \"Refrigerator (Rolled) Cookies,\" which appeared in his seminal How to Cook Everything. She substitutes high-in-fiber whole-wheat flour for regular all-purpose flour, uses rich dark brown sugar instead of plain, and adds natural peanut butter and an extra pinch of kosher salt for a rich, nutty flavor. Before baking, she tops each cookie with a dollop of all-fruit jam, which balances out the sophisticated saltiness with the perfect hint of sweetness. If you prefer not to use jam, before baking try sprinkling cookies with good-quality sea salt, such as fleur de sel, to bring out their sweetness.","hed":"Lisa Loeb's Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookies","pubDate":"2008-10-31T20:59:19.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lisa-loebs-peanut-butter-and-jelly-cookies-242769","photoData":{"id":"560d78aaf3a00aeb2f1cb5f4","filename":"242769.jpg","caption":"Lisa Loeb's Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookies","credit":"Epicurious","promoTitle":"Lisa Loeb's Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookies","title":"Lisa Loeb's Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookies","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cookies","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.82,"ingredients":["2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened","1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar","3/4 cup creamy natural peanut butter","1 large egg","3 cups whole-wheat flour","1/4 teaspoon kosher salt","1 teaspoon baking powder","1 teaspoon whole milk","1/2 cup all-fruit jam (such as St. Dalfour's Four Fruits)"],"prepSteps":["Using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar at high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
