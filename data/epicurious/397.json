Jews, first by barge and later by boat, used the river to bring goods here from the Mediterranean.\nThe word and the dish pilau come from Persia, taking various forms as the dish traveled around the world. In India, it became pulao; in modern-day Iran, it is called polo; and in Provence, pelau or pilaf. Rice, and therefore pilaf, traveled with the Jews to Provence, where many Persian Jewish merchants and scholars settled and lived until the end of the fourteenth century or even later. These Jews, who traded rice, cooked it for the Sabbath with fragrant spices like nutmeg, garlic, cumin, cinnamon, and saffron. Some scholars believe that Jews brought saffron to Europe from Asia Minor for their Sabbath rice. The late Karen Hess, author of The Carolina Rice Kitchen, repeatedly told me that Jews first brought rice to the Camargue. In their Inventory of the Culinary Patrimony of France, Philip and Mary Hyman relate that emigrants from the Piedmont paid a dîme of rice to noblemen in the year 1497. And although pilau and riz au safran are no longer particularly Jewish dishes in Provence, they are clearly rooted in the Sabbath tradition.\nThis simple recipe is typically eaten on Rosh Hashanah, alongside a symbolic whole roasted fish with a Sephardic sweet-and-sour greengage-plum sauce.","hed":"Saffron Rice Pilaf (Riz au Safran)","pubDate":"2010-08-02T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Nathan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/saffron-rice-pilaf-em-riz-au-safran-em-360510","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["Pinch of saffron","3 tablespoons olive oil","1 large onion, finely chopped","1/2 cup pine nuts, almonds, or pistachios","1 cup long-grain rice","1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","1 bay leaf","1 teaspoon salt, or to taste","Freshly ground pepper to taste"],"prepSteps":["Stir the saffron into 2 tablespoons hot water in a bowl, and set aside.","Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed ovenproof pan.
