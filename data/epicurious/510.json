I remember briefly intimating to a customer that I might be replacing the grilled cheese, and I was practically accosted! Because this snack is only available in the lounge and at the dining bar, people will go to sneaky lengths to order it. There have been guests who have left the table, walked to the lounge, ordered a sandwich, eaten it—and then returned to the table as if nothing had happened!\nLike a cheesesteak to a Philadelphian, grilled cheese and short rib sandwiches are my comfort food for late-night lounging. And I can't get enough of the slow-cooked short rib. There are myriad uses for it, from picking and shredding it into a hash with roasted potatoes, garlic, and herbs to a hearty breakfast with poached or fried eggs and toast. Slice it and serve it with mashed potatoes. It may be a little time-consuming to braise anything, especially without a slow cooker, but it's a dish that everyone should try at least once.","hed":"Grilled Cheese with Pulled Short Ribs and Pickled Red Onions","pubDate":"2009-01-27T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Govind Armstrong"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/grilled-cheese-with-pulled-short-ribs-and-pickled-red-onions-351518","photoData":{"id":"5609a4f26a59cdb91b5ff3f8","filename":"351518.jpg","caption":"Grilled Cheese with Pulled Short Ribs and Pickled Red Onions","credit":"Lisa Romerein","promoTitle":"Grilled Cheese with Pulled Short Ribs and Pickled Red Onions","title":"Grilled Cheese with Pulled Short Ribs and Pickled Red Onions","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Sandwich","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.45,"ingredients":["4 sprigs flat-leaf parsley","6 sprigs thyme","2 bay leaves","1 teaspoon peppercorns","1 tablespoon grapeseed or canola oil","2 pounds boneless beef short ribs","Salt and pepper to taste","","1/2 carrot, cut into large dice","1/2 celery, cut into large dice","1/2 onion cut into large dice","6 medium cloves garlic, cracked","1 cup red wine (such as cabernet sauvignon)","Sachet (see above)","3 cups beef broth","1 2-pound loaf sourdough bread , cut into 16 slices","12 ounces Bel Paese cheese , sliced thin","2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Pickled Red Onions","4 teaspoons unsalted butter, room temperature","4 teaspoons grapeseed oil"],"prepSteps":["For the sachet, wrap the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a small amount of cheesecloth and tie with butcher's twine.","Preheat the oven to 325°F.","Beginning with a large saucepan or braising pan with a lid, heat the tablespoon of grapeseed oil over medium-high heat.
