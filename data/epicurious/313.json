Beet greens (we agree with Marissa Grace that they deserve more attention in the kitchen) are usually wilted in hot olive oil with a little garlic, and they're delicious this way, but Marissa Grace plotted out ways to amplify the greens sweetness while tempering it with chiles. She has you brown garlic with shallot and red pepper flakes, then layer in sugar, black pepper, and salt before adding the greens and wilting them. Just before serving, you splash the beet greens with sherry vinegar, which electrifies the whole dish. The key here is the sugar, which caramelizes with the garlic and tightens up the sauce, so by the time the greens are cooked (and beet greens really should be cooked), it wraps them in a cloak of sweet and fiery sauce.","hed":"Pink Greens","pubDate":"2012-01-13T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marisa Grace"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pink-greens-388629","photoData":{"id":"560400e17bdffb1205b6add1","filename":"388629_hires.jpg","caption":"Pink Greens","credit":"TK","promoTitle":"Pink Greens","title":"Pink Greens","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 large bunch beet greens","2 teaspoons chopped garlic","1 shallot, chopped","1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes","1 teaspoon olive oil","1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper","2 teaspoons sugar","1/4 teaspoon salt","2 teaspoons sherry vinegar"],"prepSteps":["1.
