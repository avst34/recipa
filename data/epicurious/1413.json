This is a soft, pleasantly chewy cookie, with plenty of raisins and nuts.","hed":"Schrafft's of Boston Chewy Oatmeal Cookies","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Brook Dojny"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/schraffts-of-boston-chewy-oatmeal-cookies-102608","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.66,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups old-fashioned or quick-cooking rolled oats (not instant oatmeal)","1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","1/2 teaspoon baking soda","1/2 teaspoon salt","1 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/2 teaspoon ground allspice","1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened","3/4 cup sugar","1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar","2 eggs","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/4 cup whole or lowfat milk","1 cup raisins","1 cup chopped walnuts"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
