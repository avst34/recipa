I knew I'd try this at home. It makes the perfect topping for the cookie-crumble crust I like to make, and the perfect base for the fruit I like best with lemons: berries.

Although I am at times saddened to dispatch such charismatic and long-lived invertebrates in the name of bug cuisine, I console myself with the thought that most of the tarantulas I've acquired were otherwise destined to unsatisfying lives as classroom pets and lab research specimens.\nFurthermore, let's face it: tarantulas make for a tasty and texturally satisfying meal. Here's why. Unlike heavily armored grasshoppers, beetles, and other land arthropods, tarantulas wear an outer layer of chitin that is comparatively thin and pliable. That's right: their eight muscular limbs are chewy, not crunchy. As such, the plentiful meat on one of these animals is more accessible and, hence, the makings for a savory spider soirée.\nIf, for my birthday dinner, I could order anything I wanted, I'd request a Maine lobster or a tarantula spider. Properly prepared, either would make an awesome celebratory entrée.\nIncidentally, this particular recipe helped me best three other chefs in a series of round-robin eliminations, assisting me in bringing home the gold at the first-ever Big Bug Cook-Off, held in May 2011 at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.","hed":"Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider","pubDate":"2013-07-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David George Gordon"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/deep-fried-tarantula-spider-51184810","photoData":{"id":"54af3b79c4a891cc44ccbe7e","filename":"51184810_fried-tarantula-spider_1x1.jpg","caption":"Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider","credit":"Chugrad McAndrews","promoTitle":"Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider","title":"Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"meal","name":"Appetizer","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["2 cups canola or vegetable oil","2 frozen adult Texas brown, Chilean rose, or similar-sized tarantulas, thawed","1 cup tempura batter","1 teaspoon smoked paprika"],"prepSteps":["In a deep saucepan or deep-fat fryer, heat the oil to 350°F.","With a sharp knife, sever and discard the abdomens from the two tarantulas.

Among his many miracles, Saint Gratus is said to have aided farmers in the French Alps who vanquished a ravenous swarm of locusts by invoking his name. I chose that significant date to host a five-course bug banquet, a first-of-its-kind feast at Cafe Racer, a charmingly off-kilter drinking and dining establishment on the edge of Seattle's University District. Fifty people paid $20 each to attend this fete and to gorge themselves on Orthopteran Orzo, Locust Kabobs, a mealworm-filled Tenebrio Terrine, and a sumptuous Pear Salad dotted with Chiangbai Ants. Between courses, the café offered Bug Juice, a non-alcoholic drink, containing cochineal insect dye.\nThe event was heralded with great enthusiasm by the Seattle media. Writing for the city's alternative newspaper The Stranger, Brendan Kiley urged the Cafe Racer team to consider hosting the bug feast more than once a year. He proposed several additional dates, each of them a feast day commemorating other holy men \"who specialize in bugs&emdash;infestations of, fear of, and bites from\": Saint Magnus of Füssene (patron of protection from caterpillars), Saint Narcissus (patron of protection from biting insects), Saint Mawes (patron of protection from all insects), and Saint Mark the Evangelist (patron of lawyers).\nChinese ants from the Changbai region are sold commercially as a health supplement in Asia.
