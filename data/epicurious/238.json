In Texas, this dish is a benchmark for how good a cook or restaurant is, and everyone has an opinion about how to do it right. Good food takes time, and this recipe will help you through the pitfalls of cooking a brisket. Don't ever steam your beef; it dries the meat and makes it tough. Applying a dry rub is important with large cuts of meat. Our BBQ Beef Coffee Cure is a select mixture of seasonings paired with an earthy dark-roasted ground coffee that complements the brisket. The salt and sugars in the rub will cure the outer portion of the brisket, leaving a hearty flavor and the smoke, charred crust called \"bark.\"","hed":"BBQ Beef Brisket","pubDate":"2013-05-24T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Tim Byres"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/bbq-beef-brisket-51171820","photoData":{"id":"54afded02edcf2b41143a7d8","filename":"51171820_beef-brisket_1x1.jpg","caption":"BBQ Beef Brisket","credit":"Jessica Horton","promoTitle":"BBQ Beef Brisket","title":"BBQ Beef Brisket","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Beef","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 (12-pound) whole beef brisket","2 cups BBQ Beef Coffee Cure","2 cups ketchup","2 cups diced tomatoes","1 tablespoon tomato paste","1 1/3 cups distilled white vinegar","5 tablespoons Dijon mustard","4 teaspoons granulated garlic","4 teaspoons kosher salt","2 teaspoons black peppercorns, crushed","1/2 pound brown sugar","2/3 cups molasses"],"prepSteps":["Pat the brisket dry with a towel to remove any moisture. Generously rub the brisket with 1 cup of the BBQ Beef Coffee Cure , massaging all the spice into the meat; repeat with the remaining cure. The cure will soak up the liquid from the beef and form a crust. Place the meat on a large plate, cover with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.","Prepare a smoker for hot smoking. The standard cooking time for brisket is 1 hour per pound, smoked fat side up, under dry, indirect heat at a steady temperature of 225°F. Place the brisket on the center rack of the smoker and smoke for 12 hours. This is slow cooking at its easiest—there's no need to check the meat at intervals.","After 12 hours, use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 185°F in the thickest side of the brisket. Once that temperature is reached, open the door of the smoker and let the meat rest for 30 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to settle. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 190°F.","While the meat rests, make the tomato and molasses barbecue sauce: Combine the ketchup, tomatoes, tomato paste, vinegar, mustard, granulated garlic, salt, pepper, and brown sugar with 1 1/3 cups water in a large stockpot over medium heat. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly. Whisk in the molasses last (it will burn if added too early) and blend with an immersion blender until smooth. Season to taste.","Transfer the rested brisket to a cutting board, slice, and chop. The fully rested meat will have a distinct crust and will be tender and juicy inside. There should be a pink smoke ring beneath the crust."],"reviewsCount":9,"willMakeAgainPct":50},{"id":"54a41fa36529d92b2c007a71","dek":"1 pretzel per serving\nMost pretzels are high in sodium because salt is not only on the outside but in the dough as well.

In a medium bowl, combine the milk and yeast, stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 5 minutes.","2. Stir in the 2 tablespoons sugar, the oil, and the salt. Add the whole-wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour, stirring until the dough starts to pull away from the side of the bowl.","3. Using the 3 to 4 tablespoons of bread flour, lightly flour a flat surface. Turn out the dough. Knead for 6 to 7 minutes, gradually adding, if needed, enough of the remaining 1/2 cup bread flour to make the dough smooth and elastic. (The dough shouldn't be dry or stick to the surface. You may not need any of the additional 1/2 cup bread flour, or you may need the entire amount if the dough is too sticky.)","4. Using cooking spray, lightly spray a large bowl and a piece of plastic wrap large enough to cover the top of the bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, turning to coat all sides with the cooking spray. Cover the bowl with the plastic wrap with the sprayed side down. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place (about 85°F) for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.","5. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with cooking parchment. Set aside.","6. Punch the dough down. Divide it into 12 equal pieces. Using a small amount of bread flour, lightly flour a flat surface. Roll each piece of dough into an 18-inch rope. Working with one rope, at a point about 4 inches from each end, cross one end of the rope over the other to form a circle with two 4-inch-long tails. Bring the tails together and twist them once. Lift the twist, folding the dough to the opposite side of the circle so that the tails slightly overlap the circle, giving it the shape of a pretzel. Place the pretzel on the baking sheet.
