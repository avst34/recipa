When cool to the touch, slide the skin off the peppers and discard. Slice the fl esh horizontally into thin strips and then chop in half. Set aside.","To prepare the fennel, cut the stems and the bottom nub from the fennel bulbs and remove the outer layer if bruised. Cut the bulbs vertically in half.

Discard the hard core and set the fennel spears aside.","Chop the romaine leaves into bite-size pieces and put them in a large mixing bowl, gently tossing with the red wine vinegar and olive oil. Next, place the ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and fennel seed in another bowl and mix.","To assemble the salad, spread the romaine on a serving dish or platter.

It was in the early 1970s as I prowled the South in search of great grassroots cooks to feature in a new series I was writing for Family Circle magazine. Through county home demonstration agents, I obtained the names of the local women who'd won prizes at the county and state fairs. I then interviewed two or three of them in each area before choosing my subject. And all, it seemed, couldn't stop talking about \"this fantastic new biscuit recipe\" that was all the rage—something called Angel Biscuits. The local cookbooks I perused also featured Angel Biscuits, often two or three versions of them in a single volume. Later, when I began researching my American Century Cookbook, I vowed to learn the origin of these feathery biscuits. My friend Jeanne Voltz, for years the Woman's Day food editor, thought that Angel Biscuits descended from an old Alabama recipe called Riz Biscuits, which she remembered from her childhood. Helen Moore, a freelance food columnist living near Charlotte, North Carolina, told me that a home economics professor of hers at Winthrop College in South Carolina had given her the Angel Biscuits recipe back in the 1950s. \"I remember her saying, 'I've got a wonderful new biscuit recipe. It's got yeast in it.' \" Others I've queried insist that Angel Biscuits were created at one of the fine southern flour millers; some say at White Lily, others at Martha White (and both are old Nashville companies). In addition to the soft flour used to make them, Angel Biscuits owe their airiness to three leavenings: yeast, baking powder, and baking soda. Small wonder they're also called \"bride's biscuits.\" They are virtually foolproof.","hed":"Angel Biscuits","pubDate":"2013-06-18T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jean Anderson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/angel-biscuits-51175800","photoData":{"id":"54af462b4074bdfd0683816a","filename":"51175800_biscuits_1x1.jpg","caption":"Angel Biscuits","credit":"Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"Angel Biscuits","title":"Angel Biscuits","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["5 cups sifted all-purpose flour (preferably a fine southern flour; see headnote)","1 tablespoon baking powder","1 teaspoon baking soda","1/4 cup sugar","2 teaspoons salt","1 cup firmly packed vegetable shortening or lard or a half-and-half mixture of the two","2 cups buttermilk","One 1/4- ounce package active dry yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup very warm water (105°to 115°F.)"],"prepSteps":["1.

My family's sauce recipe, which my parents were just beginning to market when my father suddenly passed away, is what got me into cooking competitive barbecue in the first place.
