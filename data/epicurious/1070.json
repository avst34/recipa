Unlike pasta made with other types of wheat flour, pasta made from semolina does not become mushy during cooking. The old-fashioned way of making these pellets is to mix semolina flour with water, roll the dough into tiny balls, sift it over a medium-meshed wire sieve to remove any excess flour, then steam the final product over boiling water or a stew. Instant couscous, available at most supermarkets, is prepared by adding boiling water. Although not as fluffy as the classic type, it is more than acceptable for seffa and easy to prepare. Israelis make a larger form of couscous, which is lightly toasted; do not substitute for the regular type.\nIn the Maghreb, couscous is both everyday fare—served in most households, both rich and poor, several times a week—and a food for special occasions. It is most commonly used as the base for flavorful meat, poultry, fish, or vegetable stews. For special occasions, however, it is sweetened and topped with dried fruits and nuts. Seffa is also made by mounding couscous on a platter and sprinkling sugar on top instead of stirring it. Seffa with dried fruits is a traditional Moroccan Hanukkah dish. For Rosh Hashannah, it is sprinkled with pomegranate seeds or small grapes. On Tu b'Shevat and other special occasions, it is garnished with datils rellenos (stuffed dates) and dried fruit. Moroccans prefer desserts rich and sugar, and their seffa is generally sweeter than Tunisian versions.","hed":"Maghrebi Sweet Couscous (Seffa)","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gil Marks"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/maghrebi-sweet-couscous-seffa-104020","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"African","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["4 cups boiling water","1 pound (2 2/3 cups) instant couscous","Pinch of salt","About 1/2 cup sugar","1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or 1 tablespoon grated orange zest","1/4 cup (1/2 stick) melted unsalted butter or olive oil","About 1 1/2 cups milk or almond milk (see Variations below), or 3/4 cup orange juice, or 3/4 cup water and 1 to 4 tablespoons orange blossom water","Additional ground cinnamon for garnish"],"prepSteps":["1.
