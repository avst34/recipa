It has become a traditional Middle Eastern Rosh Hashannah and Purim treat but is enjoyed at celebrations throughout the year. There are numerous variations of baklava, many a closely guarded secret passed down within families. A walnut filling is more prevalent in the Levant, while pistachios and pistachio-almond fillings are preferred in Iran. Blanched almonds are traditional on Rosh Hashannah to produce a light color so that the year should be dulce y aclarada (\"sweet and bright\"). Sephardim refrain from serving dark-colored pastries such as those made from walnuts on Rosh Hashannah, which would portend a dark year. Although purists disdain anything except the classic nut filling, some cooks innovated by adding such items as dates and chocolate chips. Hungarians make an apricot version. This very rich treat is usually served in small portions.","hed":"Middle Eastern Nut-Filled Multilayered Pastry (Baklava)","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gil Marks"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/middle-eastern-nut-filled-multilayered-pastry-baklava-103991","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.81,"ingredients":["3 cups sugar, or 2 cups sugar and 1 cup honey","1 1/2 cups water","2 tablespoons lemon juice","2 tablespoons light corn syrup (optional)","2 (3-inch) sticks cinnamon (optional)","4 to 6 whole cloves, or 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)","1 pound blanched almonds, pistachios, walnuts, or any combination, finely chopped or coarsely ground (about 4 cups)","1/4 cup sugar","1 to 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon","1/4 teaspoon ground cloves or cardamom (optional)","1 pound (about 24 sheets) phyllo dough","About 1 cup (2 sticks) melted butter or vegetable oil"],"prepSteps":["1.
