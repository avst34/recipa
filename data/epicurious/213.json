Filled with leftover turkey, mashed potatoes, and peas or green beans, these samosas are a Thanksgiving-themed take on a dish from Pomeroy's newest restaurant, Expatriate. At the restaurant, Pomeroy serves the samosas over a cabbage and herb salad, and drizzled with tamarind brown butter dressing, but the samosas are so flavorful, we like them on their own. If you want to include a dipping sauce or two, Pomeroy recommends this Cilantro-Mint Chutney and/or purchased mango chutney. Of course, you can always serve them on a bed of greens.\nIf you prefer less heat, remove the seeds from the chiles in the samosa filling, or use just one chile.\nFor more on Pomeroy, plus four more chefs' recipes for transforming your Thanksgiving extras, see The Five Best Leftover Turkey Recipes.","hed":"Turkey Samosas","pubDate":"2013-09-25T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Naomi Pomeroy"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/turkey-samosas-51197210","photoData":{"id":"54ad652d19925f464b3b5fea","filename":"51197210_turkey-samosas_1x1.jpg","caption":"Turkey Samosas","credit":"Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"Turkey Samosas","title":"Turkey Samosas","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Indian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon fine sea salt","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","4 ounces (10 tablespoons) vegetable shortening, preferably trans-fat-free, cut into small pieces","3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water","4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter","1/2 small yellow onion, chopped","1 teaspoon garam masala","1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds","1/2 teaspoon black or regular cumin seeds","1/2 teaspoon yellow Madras curry powder","4 large cloves garlic, minced","3 cups chopped cooked turkey or rotisserie chicken","1 cup mashed potatoes","1/2 cup cooked peas or diced green beans","1 or 2 fresh hot red or green chiles, thinly sliced","Fine sea salt","1/2 gallon vegetable or canola oil","Cilantro-Mint Chutney (optional)","Purchased mango chutney (optional)","Equipment: Pastry brush; 1 large baking sheet; deep-fry thermometer","",""],"prepSteps":["In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the shortening and use a pastry blender or 2 forks to cut the shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles a coarse meal. Gradually add the water in 3 batches and use the pastry blender or forks to gently work it into the dough (the dough will be shaggy at first). Transfer to a work surface, and knead the dough until it's hydrated and starting to smooth out, about 5 minutes (the surface of the dough will still appear shaggy; it will smooth out during resting). Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 2 hours.","In a heavy large saucepan over moderate heat, melt the butter.

Adjust the seasoning as needed with salt and set aside to let cool before filling the samosas.","Divide the samosa dough into 6 equal parts and roll each into a ball. On a lightly floured surface using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each ball into a circle that measures about 8 inches across and is about 1/8 inch thick. DO AHEAD: The circles of samosa dough can be made ahead, layered between sheets of wax paper, wrapped in a double layer of plastic, and refrigerated for 24 hours or frozen up to 3 months. Defrost before using.","Cut the dough circles in half, so that there are 12 semicircles. Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the flat edge of 1 semicircle with water then fold 1 corner up and over middle. Fold the second corner over to make a triangle, and pinch the corners of the triangle to seal (leave the rounded side open). Hold the triangle in your hand with the open rounded side facing up and let dough fall open to make a cone. Fill with 1/4 cup filling, lightly brush the remaining open edge of the dough with water and then pinch along the rounded side to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. DO AHEAD: Filled samosas can be frozen, well wrapped in plastic, up to 3 months.

This savory whole-grain breakfast bowl is inspired by those California days, with chunks of ripe avocado, crumbled Cotija cheese, toasty almonds, and a citrus-sparked yogurt sauce. While alfalfa sprouts were prevalent when I was growing up, today I try to branch out, using a tangle of colorful bean sprouts or more delicate radish or sunflower sprouts. These morning bowls couldn't be easier to prepare, but the barley does take a while to cook; I put a pot on the stove first thing in the morning so it'll be ready by the time I've had my coffee and prepped the other ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other grains, too. I've tried this with both quinoa and farro, and it's as wonderful with delicate grains as it is with heartier ones.\nMorning Notes: Cotija cheese is popular in Mexican and Latin dishes. It's a firm, crumbly cheese made of cow's milk and is used so often because it's milder than feta or even goat cheese and softens with heat but doesn't fully melt.
