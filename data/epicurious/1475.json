We've also added some tips of our own below._\n_\nFor a complete guide to Basque cuisine, [click here](http://epi.dev.advance.net/eat/going_global/?/eat/going_global/basque/intro.\nhtml)._\nGenerous amounts of sparkling wine or cava are downed in the northeast of Spain every day. Unlike Americans, who reserve a touch of the bubbly for special occasions, in the shadows of the Spanish Pyrenees it is a favorite aperitif before lunch or dinner. This beverage is produced by essentially the same method as French Champagne, and sells for a small fraction of the price. Driving through towns in the Penedès area, one will find producers of excellent cava on virtually every block. When you can drink cava for almost the same price as a soft drink, it's no mystery why cava flows freely in the region.\nAfter experiencing a dazzling meal and the gracious hospitality of Martín Berasategui, one of the top Basque chefs, at the restaurant that bears his name in Lasarte-Oria, he gave us a final taste of his talent in a wonderfully refreshing granizado de cava.

We've also added some tips of our own below._\n_\nFor a complete guide to Basque cuisine, [click here](http://eat.epicurious.com/eat/going_global/?/eat/going_global/basque/intro.\nhtml)._\nBeans have long been an important diet component from Asturias (fabada asturiana) to Toulouse (cassoulet). They are easily stored and in centuries past could enable a rural family to eat well during winter. Tolosa is a Basque town in Guipúzcoa, Spain, near the French border and San Sebastián. Known for manufacturing the familiar Basque berets, on Saturdays it also hosts a colorful farmers' market in the village square where visitors can sample local produce. Red beans of Tolosa are often referred to as black beans, and their cultivation is concentrated primarily in Guipúzcoa. The Basque consider this bean variety to be the best tasting that can be had. Tolosa has long been famous for its stews made of these local red beans. Periodically, the area's chefs have contests to vie for the recognition of preparing the best. As with many widely made classic dishes, the recipe for alubias de Tolosa will vary with each Basque cook; however, this version is fairly representative. The town of Gernika also lays claim to having outstanding beans for this recipe. This dish is often served with pickled guindillas, a pencil-thin, regional, spicy green pepper.","hed":"Red Beans of Tolosa Stew","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marina Chang"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/red-beans-of-tolosa-stew-109504","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Spanish/Portuguese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.4,"ingredients":["2 cups (1 pound) small red or black beans","4 tablespoons olive oil","1 pound pork ribs","1/4 pound salt pork or bacon","1 medium onion, chopped","3 cloves garlic, chopped","2 links chorizo sausage, whole or chopped in sections","2 links morcilla (blood) sausage, whole","Salt and pepper (optional)",""],"prepSteps":["Place beans in a large bowl or pot and fill with water at least 2 inches past the top of beans.
