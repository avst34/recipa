In this recipe, I have added a new layer—a reduction of sour cherry jam mixed with balsamic vinegar and brandy—between the chocolate shortbread and the chocolate mousse. I find the taste of the whole cake to be more complex and enjoyable as a result.","hed":"Sour Cherry Chocolate Mousse Cake","pubDate":"2006-05-16T20:12:56.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marla Orenstein"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sour-cherry-chocolate-mousse-cake-234337","photoData":{"id":"56143479928970611e0a9aba","filename":"234337.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Sour Cherry Chocolate Mousse Cake","promoTitle":"","title":"Sour Cherry Chocolate Mousse Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.75,"ingredients":["3/4 cup sour cherry jam or preserves","1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar","2 tablespoons calvados (or other type of brandy)","2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off","3 tablespoons sugar","1/2 cup all-purpose flour","1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened","2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder","1/8 teaspoon salt","1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (from a 1/4-oz envelope)","3 tablespoons cold water","1/2 cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella (5 oz)","1/2 cup mascarpone (1/4 lb)","1 1/2 cups chilled heavy cream","2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder","3 tablespoons sugar","1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream","3 1/2 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped","","an 8-inch (20-cm) springform pan; parchment paper"],"prepSteps":["In a small saucepan stir together the cherry jam, balsamic vinegar, and calvados.
