My wife, Barbara, and I dined at a table for two strewn with rose petals in an open pavilion facing a lily pond. A team of chefs cooked for us and us alone on portable grills over charcoal.

It's made by impaling layers of meat on an oversize spit with a flat base and roasting the meat in an upright rotisserie. There are at least three advantages to this singular method of cooking. The dripping fat bastes the meat below it; the meat is sliced to order (at least it should be) from the outside, which gives every customer a crusty end cut; and because the crusty meat slices are piled on pita bread with fresh vegetables, pickles, and tahini sauce, you get a whole meal—and a healthful one—in a single sandwich. Traditionally, shawarma was made with lamb, but more and more Israeli grill masters use thinly sliced chicken or turkey. Shawarma is easy to prepare if you have a vertical rotisserie, and somewhat more challenging to adapt to the home grill. But direct-grilling the turkey slices does give you a close approximation of the taste and texture of classic shawarma.","hed":"Turkey Shawarma with Tomato Relish and Tahini Sauce","pubDate":"2009-06-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Steven Raichlen"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/turkey-shawarma-with-tomato-relish-and-tahini-sauce-353778","photoData":{"id":"5609a5a562fa7a9917c25920","filename":"353778_hires.jpg","caption":"Turkey Shawarma with Tomato Relish and Tahini Sauce","credit":"Hans Gissinger","promoTitle":"Turkey Shawarma with Tomato Relish and Tahini Sauce","title":"Turkey Shawarma with Tomato Relish and Tahini Sauce","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Middle Eastern","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.78,"ingredients":["2 1/2 pounds 1/4-inch-thick turkey cutlets","2 onions, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds","1 tablespoon turmeric","2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt","2 teaspoons ground coriander","1 teaspoon ground cumin","1 teaspoon ground black pepper","1 teaspoon ground white pepper","1 teaspoon hot paprika or cayenne pepper","8 tablespoons (about) extra-virgin olive oil, divided","8 whole pita breads","Tomato Relish","Tahini Sauce","1 cup thinly sliced pickled eggplant* or sour dill pickles",""],"prepSteps":["Arrange turkey cutlets in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish.
