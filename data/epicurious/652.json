I've adapted it in a recipe that takes just over an hour to cook. Traditionally, this type of dish would probably have been made with just the lamb knuckles, but I've added the shoulder to provide some additional meat. The sweet and savory flavors are wholly authentic; the dish is like a curry with an extra measure of sweetness to balance the hot spice. You'll taste the delightful hint of cinnamon, which speaks unmistakably of the Orient. It's great with aromatic basmati rice, flavored with chicken stock, turmeric, garlic, and raisins.","hed":"Tomato Lamb Bredie","pubDate":"2007-06-04T06:14:43.000Z","author":[{"name":"Colin Cowie"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tomato-lamb-bredie-238843","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"African","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1.5,"ingredients":["4 1/2 tablespoons sunflower oil (or some other medium to light vegetable oil)","2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)","3 bay leaves","3 cinnamon sticks","2 1/2 pounds lamb knuckles, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes","1 1/2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes","3 tablespoons all-purpose flour","1/4 cup white wine","1 large ripe tomato (1/2 pound) peeled and chopped","4 garlic cloves, crushed","2 teaspoons coarse sea salt","1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","1 spicy red dry chili pepper, crushed (approximately 1 tablespoon; the amount can be adjusted according to taste), or 1/2 tablespoon hot red pepper flakes","2 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste","4 medium potatoes, peeled, quartered and placed in a bowl of cold water","2 1/2 tablespoons sugar","2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley or cilantro, for garnish"],"prepSteps":["1.

It's heartwarming and incredibly convenient: It can be made days in advance and frozen, with no effect on the delicious result. For Christmastime, add 1/2 cup glacéed cherries to the batter; these holiday treats are the red and green cherries, preserved in jars.","hed":"Cape Brandy Tart with Brandy Sauce","pubDate":"2007-06-04T04:41:20.000Z","author":[{"name":"Colin Cowie"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/cape-brandy-tart-with-brandy-sauce-238845","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Mixer","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["1 cup pitted, chopped dates","1 teaspoon baking soda","2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine, softened","1 cup superfine sugar","1 large egg","1 1/2 cups flour","Pinch of salt","3 teaspoons baking powder","1/2 cup pecans or walnuts, chopped","Brandy sauce","1 to 2 cups whipped cream, for topping","1/2 cup sugar","1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/4 cup brandy (or rum)"],"prepSteps":["1.
