The cherry or fig compote can also be served on top of the ice cream, rather than layered into it.\nThe combination of these flavors reminds me of the center of a cheese Danish. Roasted red cherries burst with concentrated sweet cherry flavor.\nAs for the goat cheese, find a fresh, locally prepared cheese if you can; it will be the most flavorful and have the cleanest finish.
