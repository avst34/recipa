Equally lofty: the Jewish momma who can roll her kreplach dough to optimum thinness (so that, according to Sam Levenson, \"a tempting bit of their buried treasure should show through\"). If the wrappers are not paper-thin, your kreplach will taste like \"craplach.\" However, though we've included wrappers in this recipe, there's really no reason to knock yourself out making them.

Stuffed cabbage has been a staple of Jewish cooking since the fourteenth century, when it was introduced in Russia by Tartars. There are an infinity of recipes for it, both Eastern European and Middle Eastern; ours, in a sweet-and-sour sauce, is of Polish derivation.\nNote: When you're confronted with a bin of cabbages, you'll notice that some are quite light, whereas others have the heft of bowling balls.

Fill a very large stockpot three-quarters full with water and bring to a rapid boil.

Lift out the core, making a hole about 2 inches wide and 2 1/2 inches deep. This is a bit difficult — persevere.","4. Set out a baking tray neat the stove.

With a small, sharp knife, trim off the tough outer spines and discard them.","5. Find your largest leaves, and set them out on a plate. Set out all other leaves on another plate. One at a time, line each large leaf with another large leaf or two smaller leaves. (The idea is to strengthen your cabbage wrapping so that the stuffing stays securely inside during cooking. Be sure to align the spines of inner and outer leaves.) Stuff with 3/4 cup of the meat-rice mixture, roll very tightly along the spine, and close both sides by tucking them in with your fingers. The spine should be vertical in the center of tour roll.","6. Stir the 4 cups of chopped cabbage into the sauce. Pour 3/4 inch of the sauce into a large, wide-bottomed stockpot.
