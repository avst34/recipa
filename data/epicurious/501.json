The key to making this dish taste as good as possible is to use high-quality roasted sweet peppers preserved in extra virgin olive oil. I usually make my own oil, and have them on hand. All you need to do is roast the peppers whole under the broiler, let them cool, peel them, and store them in a container in the fridge covered with good olive oil. You can pour a few tablespoons of the pepper-infused oil into the baking dish for added flavor. As for the beans themselves, the trick is to get the texture right. Giant beans need first to be soaked, then boiled, and finally baked. Once done, they should be soft, almost buttery, without being baked to the point that they fall apart.","hed":"Giant Beans Baked with Roasted Red Peppers and Pastourma","pubDate":"2009-03-11T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Diane Kochilas"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/giant-beans-baked-with-roasted-red-peppers-and-pastourma-230526","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Greek","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.75,"ingredients":["1/2 bag (1/4 pound) Greek giant beans or butter beans","1/2 cup water","3 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup extra virgin Greek olive oil","1 large red onion, finely chopped","1 large garlic clove, finely chopped","4 large roasted red bell peppers, preserved in olive oil","Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste","","2 bay leaves","4 to 6 slices pastourma to taste","2 to 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar to taste"],"prepSteps":["1.
