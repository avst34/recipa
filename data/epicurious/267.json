The end result, which gets slathered all over spareribs that have been slow-roasted in the oven and baked at a high temperature until the two entities combine, makes for a sticky, tangy, unforgettable take on good old-fashioned ribs. If you're feeding a crowd, the oven is your best bet for that final step; if you have the time, though, try broiling the ribs with the glaze on top. The rib and the glaze fuse together and, if you take it far enough (just before it turns black), you get a crispy, sweet, and succulent rib that'll be your new standard from now on.","hed":"Sweet-and-Sour Balsamic-Glazed Spareribs","pubDate":"2012-11-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Adam Roberts"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sweet-and-sour-balsamic-glazed-spareribs-51129400","photoData":{"id":"54b05285fca98987608affd7","filename":"51129400_spareribs_1x1.jpg","caption":"Sweet-and-Sour Balsamic-Glazed Spareribs","credit":"Johnny Miller","promoTitle":"Sweet-and-Sour Balsamic-Glazed Spareribs","title":"Sweet-and-Sour Balsamic-Glazed Spareribs","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Pork","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["2 racks spareribs","Kosher salt","4 to 6 sprigs of fresh thyme","2 1/2 cups balsamic vinegar (don't waste your best balsamic here)","1/2 cup honey","2 cups ketchup","1 can beer (preferably dry)","1 tablespoon minced garlic","1 red onion, diced","1/2 cup dark brown sugar","1 tablespoon molasses","1/4 cup grainy mustard","1 or 2 teaspoons Tabasco (depending on how spicy you like it)","1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce","1/2 cup water"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 250°F and place each rack of ribs on a square of aluminum foil.
