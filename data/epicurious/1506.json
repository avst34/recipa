Once you've tasted one, you'll know why — they are really delicious. This version is more of a pudding than a bread because it is quite moist and cheesy in texture. It makes a wonderful side dish to replace potatoes or rice, or it is quite satisfying eaten as a light entrée or lunch with a salad of fresh young greens.","hed":"Chile and Chorizo Cornbread","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bruce Aidells"},{"name":" Denis Kelly"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chile-and-chorizo-cornbread-104790","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.62,"ingredients":["1/2 pound Chorizo, removed from casing","1 cup yellow cornmeal","1 tablespoon baking powder","1/2 teaspoon salt","2 eggs, lightly beaten","1 cup sour cream or yogurt","1 (8-ounce) can creamed corn","4 fresh Anaheim chiles, fire-roasted, peeled, and chopped","1 fresh jalapeno chile, seeded and finely chopped or 1 (4-ounce) can green chiles chopped","2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350°.","Crumble and fry the Chorizo in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes to render some of the fat.
