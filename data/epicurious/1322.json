The layers are a basic pound cake, and the frosting is a simple cream-cheese variation. Sandwiched between the layers is store-bought jam.\nWe know the thought of freezing your showpiece layers can be a little scary. We've tested several, however, and want to emphasize that it’s infinitely better to freeze the layers up to one month (don't refrigerate them) than to have them dry out at room temperature.\nFinally, you'll need some sort of base for the assembled cake. This can be anything from a very large platter to a piece of wood covered with tulle.\nImportant: Two separate batches of the following batter are required in this recipe. You'll need twice the quantity of the batter ingredients below, but do not double when mixing the ingredients.","hed":"Wedding Cake with Blackberries and Roses","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/wedding-cake-with-blackberries-and-roses-102253","photoData":{"id":"5612e621ce6afd7f75653e2a","filename":"102253.jpg","caption":"Wedding Cake with Blackberries and Roses","credit":"Melanie Acevedo","promoTitle":"Wedding Cake with Blackberries and Roses","title":"Wedding Cake with Blackberries and Roses","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.08,"ingredients":["12 large eggs","3/4 cup milk","2 tablespoons vanilla","1 1/2 teaspoons salt","6 cups cake flour (not self-rising)","6 sticks unsalted butter (1 1/2 pounds), softened","3 cups sugar","4 cups lemon syrup","2 1/3 cups rose hip, rose fruit, or seedless blackberry jam (about 3 jars, 12 ounces each)","Cream-cheese frosting","8 (1/2-pint) containers blackberries (about 8 cups)","1 (12- by 2-inch) cake pan","1 (9- by 2-inch) cake pan","1 (6- by 2-inch) cake pan","2 packages Magi-Cake or homemade foil strips","1 (12-inch) serrated knife","4 (11-inch) cardboard rounds","4 (8-inch) cardboard rounds","4 (6-inch) cardboard rounds, trimmed to 5-inch rounds","1 medium-size piping bag and 3/16-inch plain tip","","Cake base or large platter","5 (8-inch) plastic straws","Cake-decorating turntable (optional but very helpful)","Garnish: petals from 3 large organic and nontoxic roses and blackberries (optional)",""],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 350°F.

Lascourrèges)\nThis is an interpretation of a recipe given to me by Denise Lascourrèges, whom our son christened \"Madame Châtaigne.\" It was she who revealed to us the marvelous Gascon woods, which were so full of chestnuts we had to dodge those falling from the trees.\nMme. Lascourrèges raises her own chickens and ducks, and the appear frequently on her table. At her house I found ways of preparing chicken that departed from the norm. This recipe, which relies on the sweet heat of shallots and the bite of vinegar, intrigued me most of all, and I've made it often since I returned from her farm. I use the oven most often, though occasionally I cook it on the grill, which is the way Mme. Lascourrèges usually makes it.\nIn general, French farm cooks use a lot of shallots, which here turn dark and caramelized — some turn almost black — but they don’t get bitter. Instead, their flavor intensifies. The vinegar adds a pleasant tartness; the oil smooths all. At the last minute I like to add parsley, which scents the whole dish with its slight anise flavor. Consider it an option — it is my addition to Mme. Lascourrèges’s recipe.\nTry this with a lightly chilled dry red Bordeaux, or a Chinon.\nWatch how to cut a whole chicken into parts to use in this recipe.","hed":"Mme.
