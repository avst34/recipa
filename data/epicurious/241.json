Let stand while you make the sauce.","Using a vegetable peeler, remove 4 lengthwise strips of zest from 1 orange—each strip should be about 3/4 inch wide and 3 1/2 to 4 inches long. Arrange the zest in one layer between paper towels and microwave on high in 20-second increments until dry and brittle but not browned, 60 to 80 seconds total. Let the zest cool then finely chop it. If desired, use a Microplane to remove some of the remaining zest from the orange and reserve it for garnish. (If desired, zest the second orange for additional garnish.)","Squeeze enough juice from both oranges to measure 1/2 cup. In a small bowl, whisk together the juice and 2 teaspoons cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved.","In a 10-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add the garlic, ginger, crushed red pepper, and dried orange zest and stir-fry until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the soy sauce, wine, vinegar, and sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves, about 5 seconds. Stir the orange juice–cornstarch mixture then add it to the skillet. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and set it aside while you fry the chicken.","Line a large rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.","In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, heat 1/2 inch of oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365°F. Meanwhile, coat half of the chicken, a couple pieces at a time, in cornstarch, making sure they are well coated and gently knocking off any excess, then transfer to a plate. Carefully add all the coated chicken to the hot oil, spacing the pieces apart from each other. Fry the chicken, turning it once or twice, until deep golden, about 5 minutes. While frying, adjust the heat as necessary to keep the oil at 365°F. Using a metal spider or a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken as done to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Continue to coat and fry the remaining chicken in the same manner, returning the oil to 365°F between batches.","Once the chicken is fried, place the skillet of reserved orange sauce over moderately low heat and bring it to a simmer, stirring and thinning the sauce with a little water if necessary. Add the chicken, and stir until thoroughly coated in sauce.","Transfer the chicken to a serving dish and garnish with the scallions, and, if desired, the red chile slices and the freshly grated orange zest.

It's like a curry powder in that there are a billion unique combinations, with each cook creating his or her own, though most include Moroccan favorites like cardamom, ginger, or mace. The blend is sold in fancy grocery stores or in Middle Eastern markets like the one near us in Pike Place Market that smells like heaven. You can also buy it online. If you can't find Greek yogurt, let plain yogurt drain a bit in a colander until thick before using.","hed":"Moroccan Salmon Crudo with Yogurt","pubDate":"2013-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/moroccan-salmon-crudo-with-yogurt-51168210","photoData":{"id":"54af56014074bdfd06839efe","filename":"51168210_moroccan-salmon-crudo_1x1.jpg","caption":"Moroccan Salmon Crudo with Yogurt","credit":"Morgan Keuler","promoTitle":"Moroccan Salmon Crudo with Yogurt","title":"Moroccan Salmon Crudo with Yogurt","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Moroccan","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.33,"ingredients":["1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh dill, plus more, coarsely chopped, for garnish","1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh mint, plus more, coarsely chopped, for garnish","Zest and juice of 1 lemon","1 teaspoon ras el hanout spice blend","1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 English cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced","1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt","1/2 pound fresh sockeye salmon fillet, thinly sliced","sea salt"],"prepSteps":["Combine the finely chopped dill, finely chopped mint, lemon zest, three-quarters of the lemon juice, the ras el hanout, olive oil, and cucumber and mix to make a chunky vinaigrette.","Smear a thin layer of yogurt down the center of a large plate.
