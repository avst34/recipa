One of the most iconic of American candies, the Almond Joy, is famous for its creamy coconut filling topped with almonds and covered in milk chocolate. Its sibling, the Mounds bar, has the same coconut center but no almonds. Although the recipes for these two candies are top secret, it's possible to make wonderfully coconutty chocolate candies in your own home.\nHistory: The Almond Joy was invented in 1946 by the Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company in Connecticut. The Mounds bar was the original version of the candy, premiering in 1921. Peter Paul used the unusual strategy of creating two very similar candies and advertising them as competing versions, encouraging consumers to pick a favorite. This tactic worked: Almond Joy and Mounds became two of the best-selling candies in the 1920s.\nServing Suggestions: Trick-or-treaters will be delighted to find these candies in the Halloween candy bag. Wrap them in foil or place them in candy cups.\nCandy-Making Notes: You can eliminate the almonds and cover the coconut centers with dark chocolate. Better yet, make both versions and give your guests a pleasant dilemna of which to choose.","hed":"Coconut-and-Almond Candy","pubDate":"2009-12-11T20:18:50.000Z","author":[{"name":"Anita Chu"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/coconut-and-almond-candy-356890","photoData":{"id":"55f1d913cf90d6663f728bee","filename":"356890_hires.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Tucker + Hossler","promoTitle":"","title":"Coconut-and-Almond Candy","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Candy","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.08,"ingredients":["7 fluid ounces sweetened condensed milk","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/8 teaspoon salt","2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar","14 ounces sweetened flaked coconut","1/2 cup whole almonds, toasted","16 ounces milk chocolate or coating chocolate"],"prepSteps":["1.

It feels firm and breaks off with a snap when you bite into it and it melts smoothly in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the flavor. Slowly heating and cooling melted chocolate while stirring puts it into temper. If chocolate is not tempered properly, the cocoa butter crystallization is uncontrolled and uneven, which results in an unattractive chocolate that is dull or has white streaks running through it. Untempered chocolate may feel rough or tacky and have a cakey, almost chewy texture. And it is more susceptible to heat and humidity, melting more easily and spoiling more quickly. Some simple candy recipes do not require tempered chocolate. However, candies such as truffles, dipped chocolates, and chocolate bars require tempering to achieve their signature appearance, taste, and texture.","hed":"How To Temper Chocolate","pubDate":"2009-12-11T19:42:24.000Z","author":[{"name":"Anita Chu"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/how-to-temper-chocolate-356869","photoData":{"id":"579fad1cbd7fde737c8377c5","filename":"how-to-temper-chocolate.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"how-to-temper-chocolate.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Candy","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 1/2 to 2 pounds chocolate"],"prepSteps":["1.

If it looks dull or streaky, re-temper the chocolate, starting with step 2.

If it cools to about 84°F to 86°F and is still fairly liquid, it can be reheated to a liquid consistency. If it has completely cooled and solidified, it should be re-tempered.
