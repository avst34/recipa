A dish of pasta dressed with eggs combined the nutrients of two staple foods for a meal that was naturally nutritious and sustaining. I love these pastas sauced withe eggs, and tasty versions can be found all over Italy, especially in Abruzzo, Molise, and Lazio (Rome), where the most famous dish of this type, spaghetti alla carbonara, originated. This Molisano version is particularly appealing, with cavatelli, scrambled eggs, and bacon, and with grated Fontina Val d'Aosta tossed in at the end—a bit out of region, but absolutely delicious here. In Molise they would use grated pecorino, of course, and it is lovely that way, too.","hed":"Fresh Cavatelli with Eggs & Bacon","pubDate":"2009-11-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lidia Matticchio Bastianich"},{"name":"Tanya Bastianich Manuali"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/fresh-cavatelli-with-eggs-bacon-356449","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.6,"ingredients":["1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta pot","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","2 tablespoons butter","8 ounces slab or thick-cut bacon, cut in 1/2-inch pieces","5 large eggs","1 batch (1 1/2 pounds) fresh cavatelli or 1 pound dried pasta","2 cups shredded Fontina Val d'Aosta","A large pasta-cooking pot","A heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger"],"prepSteps":["Fill a large pot with salted water (at least 6 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt), and heat to a boil.","Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium-high heat.
