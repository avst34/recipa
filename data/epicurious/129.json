The chicken gets a head start in the oven, but then finishes up by sharing its pan with the couscous. This way, the pasta laps up flavor from the meat, while getting crispy on top, and in turn, the steam coming up from the couscous keeps the chicken incredibly juicy. An intense slurry of anchovies, garlic, and lemon makes up most of the piquant dressing, with bursts of contrasting sweetness from the raisins.\nYou'll want a large baking pan that's not much deeper than 2 inches. Pyrex and ceramic have the potential to crack when the liquids are added during roasting, so it's best to avoid them this time. The baking dish I use is enameled metal and is 15 inches long, 11 1/2 inches wide, and with a depth of 1.5 inches, but a 13-inch paella pan would be fine. Keep in mind that if the pan is too deep, the sides of the chicken won't brown; if too small, there won't be a lovely crust on the couscous; if too large, the liquid will evaporate before everything is cooked.

All of the cooks at Payard Patisserie spent our free time talking about the places we dreamed of going and the dishes we couldn't wait to try. One of the cooks told me about how Claudia Fleming, at the time the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, had created a dreamy tapioca that could not be missed. He was right—on one of my last nights in NYC, I was finally able to try it, and thereafter every time I went to visit NYC, I made a point of going back to order it again. Sadly, it's no longer on the menu, but I've channeled it here in this version.

I get disappointed when they suck, of course, but I also get grumpy when they're anything less than perfect—unblemished, super sweet, and not a bit starchy. That's the curse of keeping high standards, I suppose: you're so rarely satisfied. When at last I do find perfect snap peas, I make this salad. I leave them raw—only the finest snap peas can be this delightful without a dunk in boiling water—and accentuate their flavor with little more than a lemony dressing and mint. If you'd like, you could add some creamy goat cheese in blobs or good old burrata alongside.","hed":"Snap Pea Salad","pubDate":"2015-04-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"April Bloomfield"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/snap-pea-salad-56389464","photoData":{"id":"5535138ea628db52384885a1","filename":"56389464_snap-pea-salad_6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by David Loftus","promoTitle":"","title":"56389464 snap-pea-salad","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"meal","name":"Side","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["1 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed and strings removed (see note)","A five-finger pinch of mint leaves (preferably black mint), roughly chopped at the last minute","1/4 cup Simple Lemon Dressing","Maldon or another flaky sea salt","Lemon juice","Large handful delicate, peppery arugula"],"prepSteps":["So long as you find the right snap peas, you'll have a smashing salad. But I find that putting your knife to them adds even more excitement, a little textural variation and attractiveness.

Slice others diagonally in half or thirds. Keep small ones whole.","Combine the peas and mint in a large bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss gently but well.
