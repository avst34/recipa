The key is to use good-quality vinegar and olive oil. I use two kinds of vinegar: a good red wine vinegar or aged sherry vinegar for crispness, and a smaller amount of balsamic for its full body and touch of sweetness. You don't need to use the precious old balsamico tradizionale, but its best to stay away from the very low priced brands. This recipe has a slightly higher than average proportion of vinegar to oil to help balance assertively flavored greens. When it comes to choosing the right oil, try to find a first-rate extra-virgin olive oil with a mild flavor, not a brand that's powerfully fruity. You don't want the oil to jump out as the predominant flavor. The exception is when many of your greens are very bitter or hot, like mustard, radicchio, peppercress, or endive, in which case a very fruity olive oil will balance and tone down their aggressiveness.\nIf you're using this vinaigrette on a salad of many varied and distinctively flavored greens and herbs, like the Herbfarm Garden Salad, I suggest you not add more herbs to the dressing. However, if you are making the vinaigrette for a simpler salad of lettuces and other greens or vegetables, try blending in one of the herbs listed in the variations that follow. The vinaigrette also presents an excellent opportunity to use an herb-infused vinegar.","hed":"Herbfarm Vinaigrette","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jerry Traunfeld"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/herbfarm-vinaigrette-107674","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["1/4 cup red wine vinegar or aged sherry vinegar","2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar","1 tablespoon coarsely chopped shallot","2 teaspoons Dijon mustard","1/2 teaspoon salt","Freshly ground black pepper to taste","3/4 cup mild extra-virgin olive oil"],"prepSteps":["Purée all the ingredients except the oil in a blender or food processor or with a hand-held immersion blender.
