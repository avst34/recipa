Everyone knows it, and the routine that they follow to make and serve it is serious business.\nIt's an unusual and labor-intensive cake. First of all, the dough is rolled out like a cookie. It bakes into a pretty hard disk that will get mildly saturated with dried apples reconstituted with spices and sugar. The apples can't be fresh, and cheating the drying process is not acceptable. Electric fruit dehydrators save the effort of sun-drying apples on the porch or rigging an elaborate clothesline system in the attic—all methods I was told about by people who have seen it done.\nOne important element of the stack cake is timing. It must be wrapped and left in the refrigerator at least overnight, longer if possible. Whether you wrap it with wax paper and dish towels, aluminum foil, or plastic wrap, one way or another, keep it well covered so the moisture won't escape.","hed":"Tennessee Mountain Stack Cake","pubDate":"2010-06-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Warren Brown"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tennessee-mountain-stack-cake-359949","photoData":{"id":"56098efa62fa7a9917c1d8ea","filename":"359949_hires.jpg","caption":"Tennessee Mountain Stack Cake","credit":"&copy; 2010 by Joshua Cogan","promoTitle":"Tennessee Mountain Stack Cake","title":"Tennessee Mountain Stack Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["21 ounces (4 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon salt","1/2 teaspoon baking soda","1 teaspoon baking powder","1/4 teaspoon cinnamon","6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter","10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) superfine granulated sugar","3/4 cup molasses","2 eggs","1/2 cup buttermilk","8 to 12 cups dried apples","2 pounds (4 cups) superfine granulated sugar","2 teaspoons cinnamon","2 teaspoons nutmeg","2 tablespoons molasses","3 cups water","Confectioners' sugar"],"prepSteps":["1.

This regional specialty is a great example of how recipes take on local styles over time. Some food historians believe the cassata has its roots in fourteenth-century Arab culture. In Sicily, the long-ago homeland of the immigrants who first brought it to America, the cassata often contains candied citrus fruits, citrus liqueurs, and a glazing of chocolate or almond marzipan.\nThe version of the cassata cake that I grew up with was quite different: a strawberry-and-whipped-cream-clad yellow sponge cake with a ricotta cheese filling. My childhood memory of the cake is that there were always leftovers that—thankfully—lasted for days. Flavorful and moist, that final piece of cake just fell apart in your mouth.","hed":"Cassata Cake","pubDate":"2010-06-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Warren Brown"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/cassata-cake-359950","photoData":{"id":"56098efb6a59cdb91b5f7876","filename":"359950_hires.jpg","caption":"Cassata Cake","credit":"&copy; 2010 by Joshua Cogan","promoTitle":"Cassata Cake","title":"Cassata Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.47,"ingredients":["2 ounces (1/4 cup) all-purpose flour","1 cup milk","8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter","8 ounces (1 cup) superfine granulated sugar","1/2 teaspoon citrus oil (pure orange or lemon oil)","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/4 cup ricotta cheese","9 ounces (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour","2 teaspoons cornstarch","1 teaspoon baking powder","1/2 teaspoon salt","3/4 cup milk","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","6 eggs, separated","16 ounces (2 cups) superfine granulated sugar, divided","8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter","1 pint fresh strawberries, washed, hulled, and sliced","4 cups whipped cream"],"prepSteps":["1.
