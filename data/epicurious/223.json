As in much of my cooking, I believe I first learned to make a frittata from Julia Child, in one of her books or her television shows.\nYou can whip up a frittata for any meal: for a weekend breakfast, or with a green salad for lunch, or supper. The frizzled leeks are inspired by a dish served at Union Square Cafe in its early years. It was the first time I saw the word \"frizzled.\"\n\"Fun word,\" I thought, and asked Danny Meyer where it came from. \"My grandmother. Louise Meyer used to serve mashed potatoes with fried onions on top,\" he said. \"When we opened Union Square Cafe in 1985, we substituted rutabaga for the potatoes, and leeks for the onions. That became our 'Mashed Turnips with Frizzled Leeks.' To avoid using the word 'fried,' I landed upon 'frizzled.' After that, frizzled leeks found their way onto everything from mashed potatoes to scallops, an omelet, red snapper, and just about everything except for ice cream.\"\nIf you don't have leeks, then thinly sliced onions, pan-roasted asparagus tips, crisped bacon all work fine. Concerning culinary substitution, I think of the Russian proverb that my grandpa Jan would trot out about many things in life: \"If no fish, then lobster will do.\" Apparently, lobster prices under the czar were less steep than they are in present-day America, but I took his point.\nAs I noted earlier, Parmesan cheese has a lot of umami, which contributes to the high FPC of this recipe, especially when I top the finished frittata with some cherry tomatoes charred at high heat and pepped up with crushed red-pepper flakes.","hed":"Sunday Frittata with Frizzled Leeks","pubDate":"2013-08-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Peter Kaminsky"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sunday-frittata-with-frizzled-leeks-51186240","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Egg","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["2 leeks, halved, cut lengthwise into strips no wider than a strand of spaghetti, and very well rinsed to remove all grit","3 tablespoons olive oil","8 to 10 eggs, lightly whisked","1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese","Freshly ground black pepper","Coarse salt to taste"],"prepSteps":["1.

For starters, because they are fresh, local, and seasonal. Unlike summer produce, they keep for a long time without losing most of their flavor. They feel like winter food: hearty, substantial, rib-sticking. Francis Mallmann quick-roasts them at very high heat in a wood oven until they almost burn. A home oven doesn't put out that kind of thousand-degree heat, but when something as simple as slices of Delicata squash are coated with a little bit of olive oil, sprinkled with kosher or coarse sea salt, and then roasted, they come out of the oven chewy, nutty, sweet, and savory. Part caramelization, part umami, and part Maillard.\nThis dish is a slight adaptation of a recipe in Yotam Ottolenghi's Plenty, which I came across when I was asked to be a judge in Food52.com's \"Tournament of Cookbooks.\" In case you don't know Yotam Ottolenghi's work—you'd never forget such a fun name—he is a London-based Israeli chef who writes a vegetarian column for the Guardian. He is not a vegetarian himself, which makes me trust his recipes even more. In other words, he is neither ideological nor moralistic about it: his only aim is food that tastes great.\nCaramelized and well-seasoned winter vegetables are fine by themselves, but the maple-mustard vinaigrette lifts the flavors enormously. We made this recipe for a New Year's Eve dinner, and afterward I received ooh-and-aah e-mails from people about \"the best vegetables ever!\"\nFor sure, the company, the wine, and the other food had something to do with the reviews. But, taking all that into consideration, tell me, honestly, how often are people moved to praise a parsnip?\nA few years ago I would have said you need your own roast tomatoes for this recipe, but now I find that Desert Glory or similar deeply flavored cherry tomatoes, though they don't hold a candle to real summer tomatoes, are fine when caramelized.","hed":"Winter Vegetable Roast with Maple-Mustard Vinaigrette","pubDate":"2013-08-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Peter Kaminsky"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/winter-vegetable-roast-with-maple-mustard-vinaigrette-51186650","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Garlic","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["8 medium parsnips, peeled or scrubbed","8 medium carrots, peeled or scrubbed","4 medium red onions, peeled and quartered","2 heads garlic, halved","1/2 cup plus 4 tablespoons olive oil","8 sprigs fresh thyme","4 sprigs fresh rosemary","Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste","","40 cherry tomatoes, halved","4 tablespoons lemon juice","4 tablespoons capers, roughly chopped","1 tablespoon maple syrup","1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"],"prepSteps":["1.

My father was Assyrian, so I've always enjoyed the flavors of the region (though the closest I've yet traveled is Turkey). This is my interpretation, and it reflects my priorities: my favorite part of za'atar is the tart sumac, so it's particularly heavy in my version. And while some cooks grind their spices together, I like to leave the sesame seeds whole. You can find sumac in Middle Eastern groceries and from online sources such as Penzeys and Kalustyan's. For a perfect, quick snack, combine with olive oil and brush on pita.","hed":"Za'atar","pubDate":"2013-08-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joe Yonan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/zaatar-51186220","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Middle Eastern","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon sesame seeds","1/4 cup sumac","2 tablespoons dried thyme","1 tablespoon ground cumin","1 teaspoon sea salt"],"prepSteps":["Put the sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat.
