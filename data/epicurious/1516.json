Neil also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page. For your convenience, we've converted the measures — with as much accuracy as possible — from Australian to American. For those who have metric equipment and wish to follow Neil's recipe to the milliliter, we've included the original measures too.\nTo read more about Neil and Australian cuisine, click here.\nThe availability of Illabo lamb on the Australian market is due to Tony Lehmann's efforts. He is one of the few Australian producers who understands what the market wants, and delivers, in no uncertain terms, a quality product that is markedly better than the bland generic produce grown for the large corporations. It is because of suppliers like Tony that the quality and variety of fine produce we have available in Australia is maintained. This is the driving force behind fabulous multicultural cooking.\nThis is the dish of the moment at Rockpool. The lamb is only 6 weeks old, and has a dressed body weight of about 8 kg (17 1/2 lbs). It is flavoursome, tender and has a wonderful clean taste that is unmatched. The accompanying sauce is rich, flavoursome and has no Asian ingredients, except for a little ginger, for good luck. The only necessary addition is a green salad à la Rockpool.\nThe recipe for Tomato Jam yields 750 ml (3 cups). It is also very good with raw fish, and will keep for up to a month in the refrigerator.","hed":"Roast Illabo Lamb with Tomato, Olives and Aïoli","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Neil Perry"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roast-illabo-lamb-with-tomato-olives-and-aioli-109293","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Ginger","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["two 1 kg (2-pound) Illabo or other milk-fed lamb legs","sea salt and freshly ground pepper","","olive oil","1 kg (2 lbs) pink-eye (or baby red-skinned) potatoes, boiled in their skins in salted water for 20 minutes, peeled and quartered","18 large green olives","18 large black olives","15 vine-ripened tomatoes, cored","1 Spanish onion, peeled and finely diced","10 cloves garlic, crushed","2 large knobs ginger, peeled and chopped","400 ml (1 2/3 cups) olive oil","1 tablespoon fennel seeds, roasted and ground","1 tablespoon coriander seeds, roasted and ground","1 teaspoon cumin, roasted and ground","6 tablespoons palm sugar","4 tablespoons fish sauce","6 tablespoons red-wine vinegar","125 ml (1/2 cup) extra-virgin olive oil","125 ml (1/2 cup) olive oil","3 cloves garlic","1 teaspoon sea salt","3 egg yolks","juice of half a lemon","freshly ground pepper","1 large eggplant","olive oil","10 basil leaves","15 flat-leaf parsley leaves","100 ml (1/2 cup) extra-virgin olive oil","1 small onion, peeled and cut into 0.5 cm (1/4-inch) dice","3 cloves garlic, crushed","sea salt and freshly ground pepper","","2 red capsicums (bell peppers), seeded and cut into 0.5 cm (1/4-inch) dice","3 anchovies, minced","2 vine-ripened tomatoes, blanched, peeled, seeded and cut into 0.5 cm (1/4-inch) dice","25 small capers, rinsed","lemon juice"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).","To make the Tomato Jam, place the tomatoes on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes.
