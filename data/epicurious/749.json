Turbot is rarely available in the United States, but another flatfish such as a fluke or flounder makes a good substitute.\nYou will need a mandoline or other vegetable slicer to slide the potatoes very thin. Ovenproof nonstick frying pans work best here, so the potato cakes don't stick, but if necessary you can use other 8-inch frying pans or cake pans; line them with rounds of parchment paper.","hed":"Roasted Turbot on a Crisp Potato Cake with Teardrop Tomatoes and Gaeta Olives","pubDate":"2006-07-19T19:00:47.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marc Vetri"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roasted-turbot-on-a-crisp-potato-cake-with-teardrop-tomatoes-and-gaeta-olives-235444","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.33,"ingredients":["One 1 - pound whole turbot or fluke, gutted and scaled","2 medium Yukon Gold Potatoes (about 1 pound total)","Leaves from 2 fresh thyme sprigs (about 1 teaspoon)","teaspoon kosher salt","Freshly ground black pepper","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","10 pear or cherry tomatoes (preferably small)","cup dry white wine","1 tablespoon white wine vinegar","1 tablespoon unsalted butter","cup pitted Gaeta olives","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","","2 fresh rosemary springs"],"prepSteps":["Rinse the fish under cold running water until the water runs clear and no trace of blood remains.
