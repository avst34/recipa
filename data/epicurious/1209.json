In trying to assess the seriousness of the problem, I have consulted government agencies — the Food and Drug Administration, the Agricultural Department, and the Centers for Disease Control — and many other food safety experts. The findings are frustrating because there seems to be no collective information as to how many eggs are infected, and how many people have been stricken with salmonella in this country, so there is no way of knowing the degree of risk one is taking when eating raw or lightly cooked eggs, which are used in many recipes. Government officials recommend that immuno-compromised patients, the very young and the elderly, all of whom are the most severely affected when stricken, should not eat raw or lightly cooked eggs. Until the problem has been licked, the rest of us are consuming eggs that have not been cooked to 165° at our own risk.

Add beans, water, jalapeño, and beer and bring to a boil. Bake mixture, covered, in middle of oven until beans are soft, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Add additional water if beans begin to dry out. Mixture should be soupy with beans very soft but not falling apart.)","Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and bake beans 10 minutes more. Check seasoning, adding remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt if necessary. (Beans may be made 2 days ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered.)"],"reviewsCount":39,"willMakeAgainPct":87}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:50:51.713Z","count":1944,"number":1209,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1210&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1208&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
