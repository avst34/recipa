recipe comes from MariaElena Sikolas-Toledo and her mother, Kathy Katevatis Sikolas, who has been cooking since she was 12 years old and, reports MariaElena, she \"continues to titillate the taste buds of those lucky enough to sit at her kitchen table.\"\nAccording to MariaElena, dried cod fish pie is exclusive to the Greek Island of Cephalonia, where Kathy Sikolas was born and raised. Cephalonia is the largest of the islands in the Ionian Sea and \"has a rich, varied cuisine.\"\nWhile the dish is not difficult to make, the recipes is a bit time-consuming, especially if you make your own phyllo dough, which MariaElena insists \"is worth the extra elbow grease.\" If you don¿t want to make homemade phyllo dough, use one package (two sheets) of frozen puff pastry. When using puff pastry, don¿t oil the baking dish and rather than oiling the top of the pie, brush it with an egg wash, which is one egg, lightly beaten with a splash of water.\nThe time commitment required for this recipe is also due to the fact that the dried cod needs to be rinsed, soaked, and poached before you can make the filling. Keep in mind that brands of salt cod can vary in their degree of saltiness so while 24 hours may be sufficient for some, the full 36-hour soak will be required for others. To test the cod, simply taste a small piece after one day—it should be pleasantly salty but not overwhelming.","hed":"Dried Cod Fish Pie","pubDate":"2013-04-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"MariaElena Sikolas-Toledo "},{"name":" Kathy Katevatis Sikolas"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/dried-cod-fish-pie-51163830","photoData":{"id":"54b017686429c4a41c091e1e","filename":"51163830_cod-pie_1x1.jpg","caption":"Dried Cod Fish Pie","credit":"Sara Bonisteel","promoTitle":"Dried Cod Fish Pie","title":"Dried Cod Fish Pie","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless salt cod (bacalao), rinsed well and cut into 4 or 5 large pieces","1/4 cup olive oil","1 medium onion, diced","3 cloves garlic, minced","1 cup long-grain white rice","2 ripe tomatoes, peeled and finely chopped","1 cup tomato purée","2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint","2 tablespoons chopped fresh marjoram or oregano","1 packed teaspoon finely grated orange zest (from 1 orange)","1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/2 teaspoon ground allspice","Table salt and freshly ground black pepper","","5 cups all-purpose flour","1/2 cup dry white wine","1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for brushing the baking dish and phyllo dough","1 teaspoon table salt","1 to 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water"],"prepSteps":["In a large bowl, cover the cod pieces with 2 inches of cold water and soak, chilled, at least 24 hours and up to 36 hours, changing the water 2 to 3 times per day and tasting the cod to test for saltiness after the first 24 hours.","Once the cod is sufficiently soaked, poach it in a large pot of boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Transfer the cod to a large bowl and reserve 2 cups of the poaching liquid. Using 2 forks, gently shred the cod into small pieces.","In a large, deep sauté pan, heat the oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Add the shredded cod, along with the rice and chopped tomatoes, stir to combine, and cook for 10 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper, remove from the heat, and set aside while you make the phyllo dough.","Place the flour in a large bowl and create a well in the center. Add the wine, olive oil, and salt to the well and use your hands to gradually combine the ingredients. Once all the liquid has been absorbed, gradually start adding water just as needed, while using your hands to incorporate the water into the dough. Continue working the dough and adding water until the dough is fairly uniform and no longer sticky—you may have water left over. Divide the dough into two balls and flatten them into discs. Return the discs of dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap followed by a large kitchen towel. Let the dough rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.","Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Generously brush a 13- by 9-inch baking dish with oil.","On a lightly floured surface, roll both discs of dough into roughly 18- by 14-inch rectangles. Arrange 1 rectangle of dough in the prepared baking dish, allowing any excess dough to hang over the edge. Add the cod filling, spreading it evenly in the baking dish. Arrange the second rectangle of dough on top of the cod filling and use your fingers to roll and crimp the edges of the dough together, making sure to create a good seal. Brush the pie with oil then sprinkle it with water. Use a toothpick or fork to poke a few holes in the top of the pie to allow steam to escape during cooking. Bake the pie until the dough is golden brown, about 1 hour. Transfer the pie to a wire rack to let cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting and serving."],"reviewsCount":7,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a41f6619925f464b377598","dek":"","hed":"Cabbage Rolls with Meat Stuffing and Wild Mushroom Sauce","pubDate":"2013-04-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Anne Applebaum "},{"name":" Danielle Crittenden"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/cabbage-rolls-with-meat-stuffing-and-wild-mushroom-sauce-51165200","photoData":{"id":"54b0106ac418ca0f1657d970","filename":"51165200_cabbage-rolls_1x1.jpg","caption":"Cabbage Rolls with Meat Stuffing and Wild Mushroom Sauce","credit":"Bogdan & Dorota Bia&#322;y","promoTitle":"Cabbage Rolls with Meat Stuffing and Wild Mushroom Sauce","title":"Cabbage Rolls with Meat Stuffing and Wild Mushroom Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Eastern European/Russian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.8,"ingredients":["2 large heads savoy cabbage","5 tbsp/70 g unsalted butter","1/4 cup/40 g coarsely chopped onion","4 cups/630 g cooked white rice","1 lb/455 g coarsely chopped boneless pork or chicken (thigh meat will be juicier, but white meat works as well)","Salt and freshly ground pepper","","2 cups/480 ml chicken broth or stock","One 1-oz/30-g package dried mixed wild mushrooms or porcini","2 cups/480 ml boiling water","2 tbsp unsalted butter","2 tbsp minced onion","1 lb/455 g mixed fresh wild mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed, and coarsely chopped (Go for an exotic mix, but if your market offers only portobello, cremini, and shiitake, these will work as well.)","1 tbsp all-purpose flour","Salt and freshly ground pepper","","1/4 cup/60 ml white wine, preferably dry vermouth","1/4 cup/60 ml heavy cream","Juice of 1/2 lemon"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas 4.","Fill a large pot—one in which you can submerse a whole head of cabbage—with water and bring to a boil. (It is helpful to use a pot with a strainer insert, such as a pasta pot, so you can pick up the insert to remove the cooked cabbage, rather than struggle with spoons or tongs.) Add the first head of cabbage and parboil for about 10 minutes. Remove and let it drain in a colander in the sink until just cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, cook the second head of cabbage, drain, and cool.","Gently pull the outer leaves off each cabbage. (Some of these might be soggy or torn.) Set these aside to line the baking dish. It helps to cut off some of the coarse stem at the beginning and while peeling off the leaves. Your goal is to have 12 to 16 perfect medium to large leaves in which to roll the stuffing. Set aside the small leaves for lining the baking dish as well. If you can get more than 16 leaves to stuff, do so—you can never have too many little doves. Pat each leaf dry and set aside on a kitchen or paper towel.","In a small frying pan, melt 2 tbsp of the butter over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until lightly browned. Remove from the heat and put the onion, rice, and chopped meat into a food processor; season with salt and pepper; and whirl until well mixed.

In Polish sagas and epics, warriors drink mead before battles. Even now it has an indefinable, and probably undeserved, reputation as a healthier form of alcohol. In Poland you can buy bottled mead, the making of which grows more sophisticated every year. At a dinner organized in Warsaw not long ago by Slow Food Polska—the Polish branch of the international Slow Food movement—Anne was served several extraordinary organic meads, each made by a slightly different method. The company that produces them, Pasieka Jaros, has been researching and experimenting with ancient methods of mead production for more than thirty years.\nThis recipe is something slightly different: It's a hot form of Honey and Ginger SpicedVodka, which you can make at home.
