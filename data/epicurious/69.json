This is ours. A simple riff on the classic spritz formula originally built to highlight Lini’s fruity, irresistible lambrusco rosato, this has become a spring-summer staple for both of us. Gentian-tinged Cocchi Americao plays the bitter role, while sour grapefruit acts as a foil to its sweetness, simultaneously pumping up the volume on the lambrusco. Built in a pitcher or portioned out in a wine glass, it’s a drink that embodies the spritz philosophy of being both beautiful and simple.","hed":"Punch House Spritz","pubDate":"2016-05-18T21:39:40.210Z","author":[{"name":"Talia Baiocchi"},{"name":"Leslie Pariseau"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/punch-house-spritz","photoData":{"id":"5730e632e12ca3c6144bc0f8","filename":"punchhouse.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Dylan + Jeni","promoTitle":"","title":"Punch House Spritz.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cocktail","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 ounces Cocchi Americano","4 ounces Lini Lambrusco Rosato","1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice","1 ounce soda water","1 grapefruit wheel, for garnish"],"prepSteps":["Build the ingredients in a rocks or wine glass over ice and add the garnish."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"5730ec2efac7828e60cd2b8d","dek":"Inspired by a cocktail from New York City bartender Natasha David, the crimson-colored Tarocco Spritz is a nod to the flavor and color of the Sicilian Tarocco orange, often referred to as the “half-blood orange.” A mixed-heritage cocktail, this drink has a bumped-up base of gin to match the vibrant bitter aperitivo liqueur Cappelletti. The drink’s acidity comes courtesy of blood orange, lemon juice, and prosecco, bound together by the unlikely addition of vanilla, which complements Cappelletti’s notes of spice and oxidation.","hed":"Tarocco Spritz","pubDate":"2016-05-18T21:37:22.042Z","author":[{"name":"Talia Baiocchi"},{"name":"Leslie Pariseau"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tarocco-spritz","photoData":{"id":"5730ea1e165207874f9c2d0c","filename":"tarocco-WEB.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Dylan + Jeni","promoTitle":"","title":"Tarocco Spritz","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cocktail","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 cup sugar","1 cup water","1 vanilla bean","1 ounce gin","1/2 ounce Cappelletti","3/4 ounce fresh blood orange juice","1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice","1/2  ounce vanilla syrup","2 ounces Prosecco","1 blood orange wheel, for garnish"],"prepSteps":["Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan.
