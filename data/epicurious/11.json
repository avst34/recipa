You don’t want the liquid touching the top of the lid, as it will end up spewing out of your air-lock or up out of your lid.","Cover with a cabbage leaf (the follower), the weight and then your chosen lid or system.","Depending on your ferment, you can start trying it as soon as you’d like, but the less you fiddle with it in the first 2 weeks, the better.

(Lucky you.) It will keep in the fridge for 12 months or more.
