Gently reheat until warm before using.","Cut the corn kernels from the cobs, reserving the cobs. Cut the cobs crosswise into a few pieces. Combine the kernels and cobs in a medium pot along with the cream, milk, salt, and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Bring the liquid to a simmer, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat, then turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the mixture steep at room temperature for at least 2 hours or in the fridge for as long as 12 hours. Remove the cobs, gently scraping them with a spoon to get at any liquid that may be hiding in them, and discard the cobs. Strain the remaining mixture through a sieve into a clean medium pot, stirring and pressing on the kernels to release as much corn flavor as possible. Discard the kernels.","Bring the milk mixture to a simmer over medium heat and turn off the heat. Combine the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until smooth. Slowly but steadily add about 3/4 cup of the milk mixture to the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Then slowly but steadily add the yolk mixture to the pot, again whisking constantly. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly and adjusting the heat if necessary to maintain a simmer, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.","Strain the mixture again through a sieve into a medium mixing bowl, pressing and then discarding the solids. Fill a larger bowl halfway with very icy water and nestle the medium bowl inside. Stir frequently until the mixture is cold. Cover the medium bowl and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.","Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze until firm. Serve straightaway or keep the ice cream in the freezer for up to 3 days.","When you’re ready to eat, scoop the ice cream into bowls, drizzle on some butterscotch, and top with caramel popcorn."],"reviewsCount":1,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"5772e66faa96752d13a93d14","dek":"This recipe can be kerneled and served on top of a burger or eaten straight off the cob, dressed in cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.","hed":"Ancho Chile–Rubbed Grilled Corn","pubDate":"2016-06-27T20:50:51.994Z","author":[{"name":"Mathew Ramsey"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ancho-chile-rubbed-grilled-corn","photoData":{"id":"577293ebe43289453ac28e58","filename":"ancho-chile-rubberd-grilled-corn-mathew-ramsey-062816.jpg","caption":"Ancho Chile–Rubberd Grilled Corn","credit":"Photo by Mathew Ramsey","promoTitle":"","title":"Ancho Chile–Rubbed Grilled Corn","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"HarperCollins","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 ears of corn, husked","1 teaspoon ancho chile powder","1/2 lime, juiced","2 tablespoons butter","Kosher salt and black pepper","Cilantro (optional), for garnish","Cotija cheese (optional), for garnish"],"prepSteps":["Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.","Put the ears of corn on the grill and cook until the kernels begin to char.

A momentary respite from jumping and leaping in the air on a cold windy netball court in the depths of winter seems to be a vivid memory from my early teenage years. Naturally, giving you a recipe for orange slices may have proven uninspiring so, with a bit of cooking magic, I would like to introduce you to my watermelon Jell-O shots… A happy walk down memory lane with a very modern twist. For an alcoholic version, replace 1/2 cup of the water with some vodka.","hed":"Watermelon Jell-O Shots","pubDate":"2016-06-27T20:48:13.103Z","author":[{"name":"Lorraine Pascale"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/watermelon-jell-o-shots","photoData":{"id":"577293e5d8009164047ba6c4","filename":"watermelon-jell-o-shots-lorraine-pascale-062816.jpg","caption":"Watermelon Jell-O Shots","credit":"Photo by Myles New","promoTitle":"","title":"Watermelon Jell-O Shots","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"HarperCollins","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["7 (2 1/2x4 1/2-inch) or 8 (3x4-inch) leaves of gelatin","16 small or 14 medium limes","4-oz package of strawberry gelatin","1 3/4 cups hot water","1 tablespoon sugar (optional)","1 large or 2 small passion fruit (optional)","Kettle, small wide bowl, large tray or 2–3 (12-cup) muffin pans, heatproof measuring cup"],"prepSteps":["Put the kettle on to boil. Then put the gelatin leaves into a small wide bowl, cover them with cold water and set aside to soften.","Cut the limes in half lengthwise, rather than around their middles, and, using a spoon, scoop out the juicy flesh. It takes a bit of wiggling and getting squirted by the juice, but you will get there! The trick is not to break through the lime skin. (You don’t need the flesh for this recipe, but afterward I like to squeeze the juice out and freeze it in an ice-cube tray for handy lime juice needs at other times.)","Set each half, cut side up, on a large tray, or put each one in the cup of a 12-cup muffin pan. They fit perfectly and don’t move around too much that way. You will need two or three 12-cup muffin pans, but if you don’t have enough, you can nestle the excess lime shells on top in between the others and they should sit still.","Next, break up the strawberry gelatin a bit and put it into a heatproof measuring cup, then pour over enough hot water to reach 1 3/4 cups.","Pick up the gelatin leaves—they will feel all soft. Gently squeeze out as much liquid as you can from them, discard the bowl of water and then put the soft gelatin leaves into the gelatin and hot water. Leave to stand for a few minutes until everything begins to melt, then stir a little until everything is completely dissolved. Next, stir in the sugar, if using, until dissolved also.","Use the gelatin to fill each lime shell right up to the very top so it is almost overflowing. Let the shells cool down for about 5 minutes and then put them in the freezer for about 25 minutes to firm up (but not much longer or they will freeze!). They will set in the fridge also, but allow double the time.","Meanwhile, prepare the passion fruit by cutting it (or them) in half and scooping out the seeds onto paper towels. Dab the seeds dry with the towels and set them aside.","Halfway through the setting time (once the gelatins are just beginning to firm up), remove them and carefully arrange the passion fruit seeds on top. Arrange about six seeds on each one, keeping them away from the middle as you will be cutting them in half later, and lightly press each one down a little so it will set into the gelatin. Then return to the freezer until completely firm.","Once they are firm, remove them from the freezer. Then, using a sharp, nonserrated knife, cut them in half, straight down (again, lengthwise), and there you have it!"],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"577301a2461d2d5d0c959579","dek":"Load up on green tea antioxidants, hydrate with electrolyte-filled coconut water, and cool off with cucumber, lime, and gut-soothing aloe vera.","hed":"Ultimate Hydrating Iced Tea","pubDate":"2016-06-27T20:44:17.709Z","author":[{"name":"Guy Turland"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ultimate-hydrating-iced-tea","photoData":{"id":"577293e97823d8090d928ce1","filename":"hydrating-iced-tea-guy-turland-062816.jpg","caption":"Ultimate Hydrating Iced Tea","credit":"Photo by Stephen Baccon","promoTitle":"","title":"Ultimate Hydrating Iced Tea","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"HarperCollins","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 cups (500 ml) green tea, frozen in ice-cube trays","12 grapes","1 tablespoon honey","1 small handful mint","Juice of 1 lime","1 1/4 cups (300 ml) coconut water","1/2 Lebanese cucumber (or 1/4 English cucumber), sliced","1 tablespoon chia seeds","1 teaspoon aloe vera juice"],"prepSteps":["Put the green tea ice cubes, grapes, honey, mint, lime juice, coconut water and cucumber in a jug, and stir.
