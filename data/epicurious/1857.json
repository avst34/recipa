The little cove in front of the house, too small to be named on navigational charts, was called Clam Cove by the locals. I never did any clamming — fishing was my thing — but I have a vivid memory of the muddy flats at low tide, feeling the soft-shell clams under my feet and seeing their tiny sprays coming out of the mud as they burrowed down to get out of my way. Soft-shell clams have two oval shells, about two to three inches long, that gape along the edges. Their most prominent feature is a siphon, about a quarter of the length of the shell, which sticks out of the clam. Whole soft-shell clams are often referred to as \"steamers,\" because that is the way they are most often prepared. When salty old-timers refer to \"clams,\" soft-shells are what they mean. Shucked raw, soft-shell clams may be called \"fryers\" or \"frying clams.\" Frying clams make a superb chowder, but they are very expensive because of the labor involved in shucking them.\nI prefer to steam whole soft-shell clams for chowder. That way, I save a few dollars and get a fantastic broth in the process. The flavor of steamer broth is sweeter and more subtle and round than the pungent broth quahogs (hard-shell clams) yield. The chowder made from steamers may have a little less strength up front, but it is equal to quahog chowder in deep lingering flavor. To celebrate the difference, I use salt pork instead of bacon in steamer chowder, I don't add garlic, and I use fewer herbs and seasoning, letting the luscious little clams provide most of the flavor. And they always rise to the occasion, producing one of the most delicious chowders imaginable.","hed":"Steamer Clam Chowder","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jasper White"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/steamer-clam-chowder-105201","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.64,"ingredients":["5 pounds small to medium soft-shell clams (steamers)","2 cups water","4 ounces meaty salt pork, rind removed and cut into 1/3-inch dice","2 tablespoons unsalted butter","1 large onion (10 to 12 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice","2 stalks celery (4 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice","2 to 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped (1 teaspoon)","2 dried bay leaves","1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold, Maine, PEI, or other all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice","1 1/2 cups heavy cream (or up to 2 cups if desired)","Freshly ground black pepper","Kosher or sea salt, if needed","2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley","2 tablespoons minced fresh chives"],"prepSteps":["1.

The process should take four or five soakings.","2. Put the 2 cups water in an 8-quart pot, cover, and bring to a rolling boil. Quickly but gently place the clams in the pot and cover again. After 4 minutes, remove the lid and quickly stir the clams with a wooden spoon, trying to lift some of the clams from the bottom to the top so they will cook evenly — but be gentle, the shells are very brittle and crack easily. Cover and continue to steam for another 4 to 5 minutes. (The broth will most likely overflow just as the clams have finished cooking.)

In any event, shrimp is one of America's favorite seafoods, so I was a bit surprised not to find a tradition of shrimp chowder anywhere in this country. The lion's share of chowders orignated in New England, but shrimp are only caught here in the winter, up in Maine. \"Maine\" shrimp (Borealus red shrimp) are small and delicate. They are good in a quick-cooked stew or pureed in a rich bisque, but they become very soft in the extended cooking time involved in making a chowder. In the Southern states, along the East Coast and the Gulf Coast, big white shrimp are abundant, but they are traditionally cooked in gumbos and \"muddles\" (seafood stews). And I found no trace of an authentic shrimp chowder on the West Coast. So, starting with a clean slate, I was able to create a chowder that expressed what I think a shrimp chowder should be.

Add enough very hot or boiling water to just barely cover the bones. Give the mixture a gentle stir and allow the brew to come to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, uncovered, carefully skimming off any white foam that comes to the surface, trying not to take any herbs, spices, or vegetables with it. (Using a ladle and a circular motion, push the foam from the center to the outside of the pot, where it is easy to remove.)","4. Remove the pot from the stove, stir the stock again, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and season lightly with salt. If you are not going to be using the stock within the hour, chill it as quickly as possible. Cover the stock after it is thoroughly chilled (it will have a light jellied consistency) and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months."],"reviewsCount":11,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a413976529d92b2c0055c0","dek":"","hed":"Tartines Provencales","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Frank Stitt"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tartines-provencales-107194","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Food Processor","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 large egg, hard-boiled and finely chopped","1/4 cup each Niçoise, picholine, and Kalamata olives (5 ounces total), rinsed, pitted, and coarsely chopped","","","2 flat anchovy fillets, rinsed and coarsely chopped","2 tablespoons drained bottled capers, rinsed","1 garlic clove, finely chopped","1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice","1 tablespoon Dijon mustard","1 tablespoon Cognac","1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil","2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil","6 (1/2-inch-thick) sourdough bread slices (from a 9-inch loaf; preferably whole-wheat)","1 garlic clove, halved","6 tablespoons soft mild goat cheese (3 ounces)","Garnish: 48 small basil leaves"],"prepSteps":["Blend all tapenade ingredients in a food processor until finely chopped but not puréed, 2 to 3 seconds.","Lightly toast bread and rub 1 side of each slice with garlic.

We had a plan, everyone had a job, and in a perfect world, we would somehow deploy the food from a cleaned kitchen to a set table, complete with ice in glasses, by 5:30 p.m. Time was scarce. To compensate, my mom had a collection of simple coffee cakes that were quick, had enough chocolate to qualify as desserts in my family, and didn't contain walnuts (as they bother her mouth).\nThis was the first from-scratch cake she taught me. It's good, easy, and practical, with chunks of chocolate and a sprinkling of spice.","hed":"Sour Cream Chocolate-Chip Cake","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Colton "},{"name":" Melanie Colton"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sour-cream-chocolate-chip-cake-108141","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.11,"ingredients":["1 cup finely chopped pecans","1/4 cup whole pecans","1 12-ounce package of chocolate chips","1/4 cup packed brown sugar","2 teaspoons cinnamon","2 cups flour","1 cup sugar","1/2 cup (1 stick) butter","2 eggs","1 cup sour cream","2 teaspoons vanilla","1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder","1 teaspoon baking soda","1 teaspoon cinnamon","1/4 cup powdered sugar (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 350°F.
