Get any high-heat grilling done while you wait for the temperature to drop.","Meanwhile, mix paprika, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, chipotle chile powder, and mustard powder in a small bowl. Arrange wings on a large rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle half of rub over top. Turn over and sprinkle remaining rub over other side. Let sit at room temperature until grill is ready.","Place wings on grill over indirect heat, leaving a small gap between each piece to allow smoke to circulate. Smoke wings, replenishing wood as needed (and adding a coal or two of charcoal as needed), until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 165°F, 1 1/2–2 hours (as long as smoke is circulating well in grill, you shouldn’t need to turn wings).","Just before wings are done, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and molasses and cook, stirring, until heated through; season with salt. Toss wings in sauce in a large bowl just before serving."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"5976559e58694170ada965b4","dek":"The genius in this recipe is in the details: a spatchcocked bird for crisper skin and even cooking, and a simple, lemony salad of torn olives and herbs for textual contrast.","hed":"Butterflied Chicken with Herbs and Olives","pubDate":"2017-07-27T20:49:58.708Z","author":[{"name":"Alison Carroll"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/butterflied-chicken-with-herbs-and-cracked-olives","photoData":{"id":"59765542c432e55b145b3e14","filename":"butterflied-chicken-with-herbs-and-cracked-olives.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Alex Lau","promoTitle":"","title":"Butterflied Chicken With Herbs And Cracked Olives BA 24072017","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"Bon Appétit","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.43,"ingredients":["2 (3 1/2–4)-pound chickens, backbones removed","Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper","6 garlic cloves, finely grated","1/4 cup Aleppo-style pepper","1/4 cup finely chopped rosemary","1/2 cup olive oil, divided","1 cup Castelvetrano or other green olives, pitted, torn","1/4 cup fresh lemon juice","1/4 cup chopped oregano","1/2 cup chopped parsley, plus leaves for serving"],"prepSteps":["The night before you plan to grill the chickens, place them on a work surface, breast side up, and open them up against the surface as much as possible.
