Let the dough stand for at least 15 minutes before rolling it out.","3 Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface or between 2 pieces of parchment or wax paper, then place the rolled-out dough in the pie pan and press into place.","4 For pies with tops, brush a little water on the edges of the bottom crust before adding the top crust and crimp the edges of the top and bottom crusts together with your fingers to seal them all around the pie. You can use your fingers, thumb, fork, or the back of a teaspoon to add a design along the ridges. Also, gently lift the edges from the pan a bit (it helps make it easier to cut and serve slices of the baked pie later on). Make little slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape (and add a decorative charm!). Another fun flourish is to add to the top crust little pieces of scrap dough cut out in shapes such as flowers or leaves. Brush the top crust with an egg wash, place on the decorative bits, and sprinkle with sanding sugar (or regular sugar) for a sparkly top.","You can use two butter knives or a fork, or pulse gently with your mixer, or use your fingers. If you want to get a fun and fancy tool, get a pastry blender, also called a pastry cutter. It's a handheld tool, kind of like a potato masher for pastry dough! Whatever you use, I recommend chilling the utensil in the freezer first, so it's nice and cold!

Of course, the taste was extraordinary because Lee Lum only cooks with fresh local shrimp that her husband, Tony, purchases for her. Before cooking, she rinses the shrimp in lime juice, a Trinidadian cooking practice said to remove the \"fishy\" taste. She prefers the Chinese custom of cooking the shrimp in the shell to protect the shrimp's succulence and flavor. Rather than rice wine, Lee Lum insists on using dark Jamaican-style rum; according to her, white rum is too harsh for cooking. This is one of the easiest dishes to stir-fry, and it is guaranteed to satisfy.","hed":"Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum","pubDate":"2012-01-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Grace Young"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chinese-trinidadian-stir-fried-shrimp-with-rum-388610","photoData":{"id":"54b26ea3a801766f773f5052","filename":"388610_stir-fried-shrimp_1x1.jpg","caption":"Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum","credit":"Mark Needham","promoTitle":"Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum","title":"Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Central American/Caribbean","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 pound large shrimp","Juice of 1/2 lime","3 tablespoons ketchup","3 tablespoons dark Jamaican rum","2 teaspoons soy sauce","1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper","2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil","1 tablespoon minced garlic","1 tablespoon minced ginger","1/2 teaspoon salt","1 medium ripe tomato, cut into thin wedges","1 large green bell pepper, cut into thin strips","1 small onion, cut into thin wedges","1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro"],"prepSteps":["1.
