is a traditional North African marinade for fish, especially in Morocco where, surprisingly, it's often used with shad. It has become very popular recently with North American restaurant chefs as a quick and easy (and cheap!) way to add lots of flavor to bland fish. Many old-fashioned recipes don't call for cilantro and parsley at all, but the fresh flavor of the green herbs adds a great deal to the preparation.\nInstead of shad, which is hard to find even when it's in season, and very difficult to bone, I use salmon steaks or fillets. You could substitute many other kinds of fish, including swordfish, halibut, haddock, and even fresh-water fish, such as catfish and perch.","hed":"Spiced Herb Marinade for Fish","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nancy Harmon Jenkins"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/spiced-herb-marinade-for-fish-107794","photoData":{"id":"57c5b55da5138f0d58edec1c","filename":"spiced-herb-marinade-for-fish.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"spiced-herb-marinade-for-fish.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"African","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.73,"ingredients":["1 large bunch freshly cilantro","1 large bunch flat-leaf parsley","8 garlic cloves, crushed with the flat blade of a knife","1 teaspoon sea salt, or more to taste","1 tablespoon fresh ground cumin, or more to taste","1 tablespoon very fragrant crushed dried red pepper, or more to taste","1 tablespoon ground sweet red pepper paprika, or more to taste","1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil","1/4 cup fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar (lemon is better, I think)","6 to 8 small salmon steaks, each weighing about 6 ounces"],"prepSteps":["Chop the cilantro and parsley leaves together to a very fine mince.
