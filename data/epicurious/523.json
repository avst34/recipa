They're not quite indie rock, but if you haven't got their self-titled debut CD in your neatly alphabetized record collection, nestled somewhere between the Velvet Teen and Weezer, then your roommate must have stolen it. Brian Ritchie's acoustic bass line has no doubt rocked your teenage dance parties, and now he's going to up the ante at your next dinner soirée. \"My strategy is to eat food at a restaurant and then try to guess how they made it. Then I add my own ideas,\" Brian explains. \"I used to live in Italy, and this is my version of something I had in Florence. This recipe is as good as what you'd get there.\"\nI picked up some wild boar from New York's Citarella Fine Foods, but I had to place an order a few days in advance, and the smallest amount they would sell me was a whopping five pounds of meat. Fortunately, this deeply flavorful stew is something I'll be happy to make again (half the boar is still in my freezer) — but if you don't have easy access to wild boar, try another type of meat, as Brian suggests below.\n\"Ragù is a winter dish characterized by meat and tomatoes. It is traditional to cook it all day, adding more liquid if it starts to dry out. Italians use fresh tomatoes in the summer and canned in winter.\n\"Making a ragù is like playing jazz. You have to be creative, tasteful, and able to adapt to the circumstances. The beauty of ragù is that everybody is free to develop their own. Aside from meat and tomatoes, you can basically add whichever other spices and ingredients appeal to you. If you don't want wild boar, substitute any other meat you like — lamb, pork, veal, beef, or venison. I have made this dish with all of those depending on availability and what looks good at the butcher.\n\"Note: I do not use a recipe or exact quantities when I cook. These quantities are just to give you a rough idea. Adjust to your own taste.\" —Brian Ritchie","hed":"Wild Boar Ragù","pubDate":"2008-12-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Kara Zuaro"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/wild-boar-ragu-238625","photoData":{"id":"57ea7dcc5380fbcb1621ee20","filename":"wild-boar-ragu.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"wild-boar-ragu.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.97,"ingredients":["1 large Spanish onion (chopped)","2 tablespoons olive oil","2 pounds boneless wild boar meat (cut for stew)","1 can chopped tomatoes","3 bay leaves","1 cup red wine","5 cloves garlic, crushed","3 dried chili peppers (crushed)","1 cinnamon stick","5 cloves","3 sun-dried tomatoes","3 anchovies or 1 teaspoon anchovy paste","Fresh or dried oregano, basil, and sage","1 tablespoon red wine vinegar","Salt and black pepper to taste","N/A","Pasta (pappardelle or fettuccine)","Grated pecorino cheese (Parmigiano is an acceptable substitute, but pecorino, being sheep cheese, complements game)"],"prepSteps":["1.

It's adapted from the cookbook he dedicated to quick recipes that can be made with supermarket ingredients, and it features a store-bought rotisserie chicken that's deliciously doctored with a sauce of dried fruit, pine nuts, and port wine. Though you can whip the dish up in less than half an hour, the flavors are sophisticated enough for a fancy dinner party.
