Though sangria is typically made in larger batches, Freeman demonstrates that it can also be concocted right in the glass for a single serving. When it comes to ingredients, he eschews the fancy add-ons found in many recipes, instead sticking to a simple formula of Spanish wine (ideally a young Rioja), Spanish brandy, and lemon juice. If you prefer, sugar can be added to taste, and different light red wines, citrus juices, and brandies substituted.","hed":"Sangria","pubDate":"2008-10-31T21:14:13.000Z","author":[{"name":"Eben Freeman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sangria-242664","photoData":{"id":"560d7895f3a00aeb2f1cb5c4","filename":"242664.jpg","caption":"Sangria","credit":"Elizabeth Perrin","promoTitle":"Sangria","title":"Sangria","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Wine","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.71,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) brandy","1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) orange liqueur, such as Triple Sec","2 tablespoons (1 ounce) freshly squeezed orange juice","1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice","7 tablespoons (3 1/2 ounces) light-bodied red wine, such as Rioja","1 cup ice cubes","2 tablespoons (1 ounce) club soda","1 teaspoon sugar (optional)","1 apple slice","1 orange slice"],"prepSteps":["In large wine glass, stir together brandy, orange liqueur, orange juice, lemon juice, and wine.
