is no point in cooking country ham and burgoo to serve just six,\" Charles Patteson advises the Derby Day host in Charles Patteson's Kentucky Cooking (1988). \"Start with the mandatory mint juleps,\" he continues. \"Burgoo, which is midway between a hearty soup and a stew, succeeds the juleps in the guests' cups as a first course.\" I hadn't known that. Nor had I known that it's traditional for burgoo to be scooped into silver mint julep cups at the annual Kentucky Colonels' Barbecue the day after the Derby. In Kentucky's Best (1998), Linda Allison-Lewis writes that burgoo must \"simmer for twenty-four hours prior to being served,\" then confides that burgoo chefs used to listen for the splatter of the \"mysterious ingredient\"—the ingredient that fused all flavors—being added \"sometime in the dark of night.\" Legend has it that that ingredient was a black snake that fell out of a tree into the first batch of burgoo.\nHistorians doubt that but most do agree that burgoo was created during the Civil War by Gus Jaubert, a French chef serving Confederate general John Hunt Morgan. At war's end, Jaubert settled in Lexington, Kentucky, began making burgoo on a massive scale, and soon gained fame as \"the burgoo king.\" On his death, according to Ronni Lundi, author of Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes, and Honest Fried Chicken (1991), Lexington cook J. T. Looney \"inherited both Jaubert's pot and his title.\" While traveling about the Bluegrass State some years ago to research my Grass Roots Cookbook, I ate burgoo every chance I got. I also learned more about this Kentucky classic. Jaubert's original recipe apparently contained blackbirds. Unable to say \"blackbird stew\" not only because French was his first language but also because he had a hairlip, Jaubert pronounced it \"burgoo.\" Or so I was told. Elsewhere I learned that those early burgoos contained mostly squirrels plus whatever vegetables came to hand. I daresay that there are hundreds of different recipes for Kentucky burgoo today. This downsized version of the burgoo served for years at the Pete Light Springs Restaurant in Cadiz, Kentucky, was given to me by Lois Watkins, whom I profiled in my book. \"This burgoo is the best in the world,\" she said as she handed me the scribbled recipe. I won't quarrel with that.","hed":"Kentucky Burgoo","pubDate":"2012-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jean Anderson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/kentucky-burgoo-395149","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.33,"ingredients":["1 whole chicken breast (2 halves)","1 chicken thigh","1 chicken liver","1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder","6 cups (1 1/2 quarts) cold water","1/2 pound dried Great Northern beans, washed, sorted, and soaked overnight in 2 cups cold water","2 large yellow onions, finely chopped","4 cups (1 quart) canned tomatoes (preferably home- canned), with their liquid","4 cups (1 quart) canned whole-kernel corn (preferably home-canned), well drained","4 cups (1 quart) canned green peas (preferably home-canned), well drained","2 teaspoons salt, or to taste","1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste","4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter"],"prepSteps":["1.

Because the stew is made in many different ways with a variety of ingredients, the \"Burgoo Song\" by Robert Myles claims, \"You can toss in almost anything that ever walked or flew.\" Many early recipes for burgoo include squirrel in addition to chicken, beef, and pork. In Kentucky, Anderson County, which hosts its Burgoo Festival every September, is known as the burgoo capital of the world. Arenzville, Illinois, makes a similar claim. But the French lay claim to the basic concept of burgoo, and it's conceivable that the word burgoo arose somehow from the French ragout (pronounced ra-goo), also a term describing a stew.\nBurgoo makers agree\n• Burgoo should be made in stages: cook the meat first, and then add the vegetables.\n• No less than 4—6 hours should be devoted to making burgoo. Some recipes call for a 24-hour cooking period.\n• Burgoo should contain more than one meat.\n• Burgoo should be prepared outdoors over an open fire.","hed":"Kentucky Bourbon Burgoo","pubDate":"2012-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Albert W.

The good news is that making yogurt is incredibly easy—as long as you keep your tools clean and don't jiggle the mixture while it's setting, it's almost foolproof. Plus, it's a fun science project for experimenters both young and old.\nHomemade yogurt requires very little special equipment. You can invest in a yogurt maker but there are many potential incubators you might already own, such as a thermos. Alternatively, you might use a covered container, set in a conventional oven (preferably with the light on), a microwave, a cooler (place jars of hot water inside to help maintain a warm environment), or a slow cooker (preheat the slow cooker but turn it off to incubate). Another option is to simply swaddle the covered container with a heating pad, blanket, or towel.\nAnd while yogurt requires at least five hours to incubate, there's only about 30 minutes of active time. You can even make the yogurt before going to bed and let it incubate overnight.\nFor your first few batches, we recommend treating yourself to whole milk, because it produces a naturally thick final product. However, yogurt can be made with skim or low-fat milk—it just will probably be a bit thinner than store-bought varieties, which often contain thickeners.\nFor more on making yogurt at home, see Megan O.
