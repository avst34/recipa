We've also added some tips of our own below._\n_\nFor a complete guide to Basque cuisine, [click here](http://epi.dev.advance.net/eat/going_global/?/eat/going_global/basque/intro.\nhtml)._\nGenerous amounts of sparkling wine or cava are downed in the northeast of Spain every day. Unlike Americans, who reserve a touch of the bubbly for special occasions, in the shadows of the Spanish Pyrenees it is a favorite aperitif before lunch or dinner. This beverage is produced by essentially the same method as French Champagne, and sells for a small fraction of the price. Driving through towns in the Penedès area, one will find producers of excellent cava on virtually every block. When you can drink cava for almost the same price as a soft drink, it's no mystery why cava flows freely in the region.\nAfter experiencing a dazzling meal and the gracious hospitality of Martín Berasategui, one of the top Basque chefs, at the restaurant that bears his name in Lasarte-Oria, he gave us a final taste of his talent in a wonderfully refreshing granizado de cava.

Using a wooden spoon, break up any ice formed on the sides and stir into the rest of the liquid. Continue to freeze and repeat this procedure every hour for at least 3 hours. The mixture will begin to take on a slushy consistency and eventually form into a sorbet or granizado of small ice crystals. Before serving, fluff the granizado by \"chopping\" up any clumps with the spoon or gently whisking the frozen mixture. Spoon into small glasses or cups and serve.","Although this can be made in an ice-cream maker, one is not needed to make this wine-based ice.

Remove bread from heat and immediately rub 1 side of each slice with cut side of a garlic half, then rub with cut side of a tomato half, using 1 tomato half for 1 to 2 slices of bread and allowing most of pulp to be absorbed by bread (discard remainder of garlic and tomato halves). Brush bread with oil, then sprinkle with salt and serve immediately."],"reviewsCount":8,"willMakeAgainPct":86},{"id":"54a431696529d92b2c014986","dek":"Most people are familiar with confit duck legs, but the French confit the gizzards, too.\nActive time: 30 min Start to finish: 30 min","hed":"Mesclun Salad with Confit Duck Gizzards and Morels","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/mesclun-salad-with-confit-duck-gizzards-and-morels-109514","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot","2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar","1 teaspoon whole- or coarse-grain mustard","1/4 teaspoon salt","3 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 lb confit duck gizzards, each gizzard halved","1/2 lb small fresh morels (preferably 1 to 1 1/2 inches), trimmed, halved lengthwise, and rinsed, or 1 oz small dried morels (1 1/3 cups), soaked (see cooks' note, below)","7 oz mesclun greens (12 cups loosely packed)"],"prepSteps":["Whisk together shallot, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper to taste in a small bowl.
