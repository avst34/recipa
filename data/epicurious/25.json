Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 250°F (keep the oven door shut!) and bake another 20 minutes. Turn the oven off and let the meringue rest another 10 minutes, then open the oven door and let the Pavlova cool for another hour or so.","To make the whipped cream, using an electric mixer (or a whisk and some elbow grease), whip the heavy cream with the powdered sugar until light and fluffy.","To serve, carefully peel the parchment away from the Pavlova (or better yet, serve on the paper to aid in clean up) and garnish as you see fit with heaping spoonfuls of whipped cream, the berries, and the toasted coconut. This is a grab-and-grub scenario, so don’t even bother slicing it—just provide plenty of napkins and scold people who don’t wash their hands before digging in!"],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"58d43985cd9936798f01a0e9","dek":"This bark recipe lands somewhere in between granola bars the snack and granola the cereal.","hed":"Granola Bark","pubDate":"2017-04-03T13:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Elisabeth Prueitt"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/granola-bark","photoData":{"id":"58d41e728d4f93266cf492ed","filename":"tartine-granola-bar-bark-032317.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Paige Green","promoTitle":"","title":"Tartine Granola Bark","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Granola","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.75,"ingredients":["1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon","3 cups/300g rolled oats (not quick-cooking)","1 1/4 cups/175g almonds, chopped","1 1/4 cups/60g unsweetened shredded coconut","1/2 cup/80g flax seeds or chia seeds, whole or ground","1/4 cup/35g sesame seeds","1/2 cup/60g almond flour or hazelnut flour","1/2 cup/120ml maple syrup or honey, or 1/4 cup/60ml of each","1/2 cup/75g coconut sugar","1/4 cup/60ml water","1 tsp vanilla extract","1/2 tsp sea salt","1/3 cup/80ml olive oil or vegetable oil","1 large egg white, whisked until frothy"],"prepSteps":["Combine the cinnamon, oats, almonds, coconut, flax or chia seeds, sesame seeds, and almond flour or hazelnut flour in a large bowl.","Preheat the oven to 325°F/165°C.
