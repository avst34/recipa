While the milk is heating, in a small bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, and salt. (Mixing the flour with the sugar will prevent the flour from clumping when you add it to the egg yolks.)

When all of the milk has been incorporated, return the contents of the bowl to the saucepan and place over medium heat. Whisk continuously and vigorously for about 3 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil. At first, the mixture will be very frothy and liquid; as it cooks longer, it will slowly start to thicken until the frothy bubbles disappear and it becomes more viscous. Once it thickens, stop whisking every few seconds to see if the mixture has come to a boil. If it has not, keep whisking vigorously. As soon as you see it bubbling, immediately go back to whisking for just 10 seconds, and then remove the pan from the heat. Boiling the mixture will thicken it and cook out the flour taste, but if you let it boil for longer than 10 seconds, the mixture can become grainy.","Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small heatproof bowl. Stir in the vanilla, then cover with plastic wrap, placing it directly on the surface of the cream. This will prevent a skin from forming.

It was filled with all of the pastries I had read about in cookbooks, learned to make at my jobs, and savored on my travels. When it came time to write a menu for the bakery, I realized it was impossible to include everything I wanted to offer. These doughnuts barely made the cut. After all, we were opening less than a block away from an outpost of the ubiquitous Dunkin' Donuts chain. But they ended up being a Flour best-seller. I first learned how to make doughnuts at Payard. A French pastry chef taught me how to make doughnuts that make Americans swoon, though they scarcely resemble what you get at the competition down the street. We only make them on Sundays, and they sell out every week.","hed":"Vanilla CreamFilled Doughnuts","pubDate":"2011-02-17T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joanne Chang"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/vanilla-cream-filled-doughnuts-364349","photoData":{"id":"54b41f9ed5e8c3e1070b1b42","filename":"364349_doughnuts_1x1.jpg","caption":"Vanilla CreamFilled Doughnuts","credit":"Keller + Keller","promoTitle":"Vanilla CreamFilled Doughnuts","title":"Vanilla CreamFilled Doughnuts","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast or 2/3 ounce (18 grams) fresh cake yeast","","2/3 cup (160 grams) milk, at room temperature","3 1/2 cups (490 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour","1 1/3 cups (270 grams) sugar","2 teaspoons kosher salt","3 eggs","7 tablespoons (3/4 stick/100 grams) butter, at room temperature, cut into 6 to 8 pieces","Canola oil, for frying","6 tablespoons (90 grams) heavy cream","Pastry Cream , chilled"],"prepSteps":["In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast and milk.

Every dessert featured ice cream, and one dessert had two. My dad and I are both complete ice creamaholics, and once I was in a position to make my own ice creams, they showed up everywhere I could put them! I made fruit ice creams, nut ice creams, spiced ice creams. You name the ingredient and I made it into an ice cream. This was one of my favorites. Originally it was a honey-vanilla ice cream, but this variation popped up one day when my vanilla supplier missed a shipment. Needing to make a quick ice cream base for that evening's service and stuck without vanilla beans, I turned to the spice larder, selected a few cinnamon sticks, and a new flavor was born. I like the way the warm cinnamon flavor melds with the natural earthiness and roundness of the honey. An added plus is that honey is a sweetener that lends itself to extra-creamy ice creams, which you'll notice immediately when you taste this one after churning.","hed":"Honey-Cinnamon Ice Cream","pubDate":"2011-02-17T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joanne Chang"},{"name":" Christie Matheson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/honey-cinnamon-ice-cream-364329","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["2 cups (480 grams) milk","2 cups (480 grams) heavy cream","1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches long","8 egg yolks","3/4 cup (255 grams) honey","2 tablespoons sugar","1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"],"prepSteps":["In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and cream.

Just prior to opening day, the Boston Globe interviewed me for a cookie story and featured a bigger-than-life-size photo of my hand holding one of these lacy sesame cookies. They are gorgeous, but the ironic thing was that I didn't intend them as a selling point for Flour. A baking sheet of them just happened to be near me when the photographer asked for a prop. I'd been using the cookies for years in my restaurant work to garnish ice cream and sorbet desserts, and I wasn't planning to make them at Flour, because they seemed too brittle and delicate for the rough-and-tumble world of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal scones. But when our doors opened, practically every other customer who walked in asked about the scrumptious-looking cookie in the newspaper and wanted to order one. We tried making them for a while, but, as I had suspected, they didn't hold up well stacked with the other cookies on our counter. Ever so slowly, we phased them out and customers eventually forgot about them.\nBut they are fantastic for making at home! This is a wonderfully easy recipe made with ingredients that you probably already have in the kitchen, except for the black sesame seeds. Seek them out—you can find them in most Asian grocery stores and specialty food shops—because they contrast beautifully with the golden brown cookie and add a distinctive flavor.
