Add butter and olive oil to a large sauté pan and set over medium heat. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and sauté until most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.","Tie the tenderloin in four places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with oil, then season with salt and pepper. Heat a large, heavy-based skillet over medium-high heat and lightly coat with oil. Sear the beef all over, including the ends, until dark brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.","Meanwhile, set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula, evenly cover the prosciutto with a thin layer of duxelles.

Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.","Preheat oven to 425°F.","On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Depending on the size of your sheets, you may have to overlap two sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef, saving ends to use as a decoration on top if desired. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet.","Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash, then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife. Doing this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking. Bake until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125°F on an instant-read thermometer, 40 to 45 minutes.
