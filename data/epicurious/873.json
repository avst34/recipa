Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and place the eggs in the well. Using a fork, slowly incorporate the eggs into the flour, until all the eggs have been absorbed. Transfer the dough to a work surface and, using the palm of your hand, lightly knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes. If the dough is sticky, sprinkle a little flour on the kneading surface. The dough is ready if, when you make an impression in it with the tip of your finger, the dough bounces back. Shape into a disk and tightly wrap in plastic film. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.","Meanwhile, make the pastry cream: In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and vanilla bean. Place over high heat and bring to a boil (be careful not to scorch the milk). Meanwhile, using a whisk, in a medium bowl, whip the sugar and egg yolks until pale yellow and frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the cornstarch and whisk to dissolve any lumps.","Remove the vanilla bean from the milk and discard. Temper the egg yolk mixture by pouring a little of the steaming milk into the yolks, whisking to incorporate. Whisk the egg yolks into the remaining milk in the pan, set the pan over medium heat, and whisk quickly and constantly until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, then whisk for another minute. Add the butter and stir until incorporated. Transfer the pastry cream to a storage container and place plastic wrap directly against the cream to prevent a skin from forming on top. Refrigerate until fully chilled, about 2 hours.","Once the pastry cream has chilled, place the hazelnut chocolate in a microwave-safe container and microwave on high for 1 minute; or melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. Remove the chocolate from the microwave and stir. Heat the chocolate for another minute, remove, and stir to melt the remaining chocolate. Add to the pastry cream and stir to incorporate. Return to the refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes.","Divide the pasta dough into 4 pieces. Using a pasta machine, one at a time, roll out each piece from the widest to the thinnest setting. Keep the remaining dough covered to prevent it from drying out.","To make the ravioli, dust a work surface with flour. Place one pasta sheet on the work surface. Starting about 2 inches from one end, place a teaspoon of filling every 4 inches down the pasta strip, ending about 2 inches from the other end of the strip. Brush the pasta dough with water, fold the dough over, and press to seal, being careful not to trap air inside the ravioli (or they will burst during cooking). Cut the ravioli into half-moons using a cookie cutter or pastry wheel. Press the edges together and squeeze to make the edges of the dough as thin as possible. Set the finished ravioli on a baking sheet lined with parchment and sprinkled with flour, to prevent sticking. Repeat with the remaining dough. You should get at least 24 ravioli. Refrigerate until ready to cook.","For the sauce, bring the heavy cream, milk, and sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate, and stir until melted. Add the butter and stir to incorporate.","To cook the ravioli, bring the water and sugar to a boil in a large pot and boil until the sugar has dissolved. Add the ravioli to the pot and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes.","Meanwhile, gently reheat the chocolate sauce.","To serve, remove the ravioli with a slotted spoon, letting the excess liquid drain, and arrange 4 ravioli on each plate. Drizzle the sauce over each plate.

The polenta adds a starch that the salmon needs, but it is also delicate and won't overwhelm the flavors of the fish. Mushrooms and polenta are a great classical pair, and a sturdy, satisfying match for the meaty salmon.","hed":"Barely Cooked Salmon with Parmesan Polenta and Mushroom Consommé","pubDate":"2005-01-27T20:58:36.000Z","author":[{"name":"Eric Ripert"},{"name":" Michael Ruhlman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/barely-cooked-salmon-with-parmesan-polenta-and-mushroom-consomme-231565","photoData":{"id":"560de526f3a00aeb2f1d530c","filename":"231565.jpg","caption":"Barely Cooked Salmon with Parmesan Polenta and Mushroom Consommé","credit":"Shimon and Tammar Rothstein","promoTitle":"Barely Cooked Salmon with Parmesan Polenta and Mushroom Consommé","title":"Barely Cooked Salmon with Parmesan Polenta and Mushroom Consommé","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.31,"ingredients":["1 pound button mushrooms","10 cups water","Fine sea salt and freshly ground white pepper","","1 pound gyromitre or morel mushrooms (see Note)","1 tablespoon canola oil","1 tablespoon chopped shallots","1 tablespoon chopped garlic","7 to 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter","1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley","2 cups milk","1/3 cup instant polenta","1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan","One 2 1/2-pound salmon fillet"],"prepSteps":["Place the button mushrooms in a pan, cover with 8 cups of the water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 3 hours.","Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the mushrooms to release the liquid. You should have at least 2 cups mushroom stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a saucepan and set aside. (The stock can be made in advance and refrigerated for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to a month.)","Trim the gyromitre or morel mushrooms, discarding the stems, and halve them. Because these mushrooms can be particularly sandy, soak them in cold water to remove any dirt. Lift out of the water, rinse, and repeat two more times.","Heat the canola oil in a large sauté pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their liquid, but are not dry, 10 to 15 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of the butter and the parsley and toss to incorporate.

Whisking constantly, slowly add the polenta, continuing to whisk until the polenta is completely incorporated. Cook for 5 minutes. The polenta will be very thin. Add the Parmesan and stir to incorporate. Set the pan aside.","Cut the salmon crosswise into 1-inch slices. Pull the ends of each side together, as if you were closing a book, and secure with a toothpick. In a flameproof shallow casserole large enough to accommodate all the salmon fillets, bring 1/4 inch of generously salted water to a simmer. Season each fillet on both sides with salt and pepper and add to the casserole.

Lagua learned this way of preparing tri-tips from his friend Sammy Ariola, one of the area's first Filipino immigrants. \"I have no money for you to inherit,\" said Ariola, as he lay on his deathbed, \"but I'll give you the recipe for my marinade.\" Since then Lagua has won numerous barbecue contests with his Filipino-style tri-tips, raising thousands of dollars for Filipino community charities. He's now working on bottling the sauce commercially, once again as a fund-raiser. The interplay of salty, sweet, and sour is pure Filipino, and the lemon rind adds an intense blast of citrus flavor. I've adapted my approximation of Lagua's recipe to London broil; in the Tips [below] you'll find instructions for making tri-tips with this marinade.

Rinse the lemons. Cut each in half and squeeze out the juice with a citrus press. Place the lemon juice in a large nonreactive mixing bowl. Cut the rind of 1 lemon into 1/4-inch dice and add it to the juice. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, oil, onion, garlic, bay leaves, coriander seed, and pepper and whisk to mix. Set aside half of the lemon juice mixture to use as a sauce.","2. If using flank steak, score it on both sides in a crosshatch pattern, making shallow cuts on the diagonal no deeper than 1/8 inch and about 1/4 inch apart.

To do this, start with a tri-tip that's between 2 and 2 1/2 pounds. Make the marinade following the directions in Step 1, then let the meat marinate for 12 to 24 hours.","• You can grill the tri-tip in the rotisserie following these steps:\nStep 1: When ready to cook, place the tri-tip in the rotisserie basket. Place the drip pan in the bottom of the rotisserie. Attach the basket to the rotisserie, then attach the spit to the rotisserie and turn on the motor. If your rotisserie has a temperature control, set it to 400°F.\nStep 2: Cook the tri-tip until it is darkly browned on the outside and cooked to taste, about 40 minutes for medium-rare. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer through the side of the tri-tip but not so that it touches the spit. The internal temperature should be about 145°F for medium-rare. If your rotisserie has a pause button, after the tri-tip has cooked for 30 minutes, stop the spit so that a flat side of the tri-tip faces the heating element and let the meat brown for 5 minutes. Then, advance the spit a half turn and brown the other side for 5 minutes.","If You Have a…","CONTACT GRILL: The smaller and thinner the tri-tip, the better the results you'll get on a contact grill (thick pieces of meat tend to burn on the outside before becoming fully cooked in the center). Preheat the grill; if your contact grill has a temperature control, preheat the grill to high. Place the drip pan under the front of the grill. When ready to cook, lightly oil the grill surface. Arrange the tri-tip on the hot grill, placing pieces of aluminum foil between the grill plates and the meat; this will slow the burning process. Close the lid. The tri-tip will be cooked to medium-rare after 8 to 10 minutes.","BUILT-IN GRILL: Preheat the grill to medium-high, then, if it does not have a nonstick surface, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the tri-tip on the hot grate. It will be cooked to medium-rare after 8 to 10 minutes per side.","FREESTANDING GRILL: If you like your tri-tip very rare, you can cook it on a freestanding grill. Preheat the grill to high; there's no need to oil the grate. Place the tri-tip on the hot grill, then place a heavy skillet on top of the meat to keep it flat. The tri-tip will be cooked to rare after 10 to 12 minutes per side (it takes forever to get to medium or well done).","FIREPLACE GRILL: Tri-tip is great in the fireplace, especially over red oak or post oak.
