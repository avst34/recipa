Scapes have a mild garlic flavor and a slight sweetness, which makes them a prized addition in the kitchen. You can find them in the early summer and midfall at farmers' markets. If you grow your own garlic (which is easy), trim the scapes off before their flowers open. This forces the plant to focus on bulb production and increases the size of the garlic cloves.\nMy Aunt Denise introduced me to the idea of garlic-scape pesto. Here I use it to sauce pasta; you can also spread it on crostini or use as a pungent dip for crunchy vegetables. If all you have are salted pistachios, forgo the salt in the recipe and add salt to taste at the end.","hed":"Pasta with Garlic-Scape Pesto","pubDate":"2012-05-11T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Ian Knauer"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pasta-with-garlic-scape-pesto-395769","photoData":{"id":"5583040881ac1e5023677e55","filename":"395769_hires-CP-6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Hersheimer & Hamilton","promoTitle":"Pasta with Garlic-Scape Pesto","title":"Pasta with Garlic-Scape Pesto","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Cheese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.52,"ingredients":["10 large garlic scapes","1/3 cup unsalted pistachios","1/3 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano","Kosher salt and black pepper","","1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil","1 pound spaghetti"],"prepSteps":["Make the pesto: Puree the garlic scapes, pistachios, Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a food processor until very finely chopped.
