(Allow 1 hour to preheat with stone.)","Stretch each dough log into a roughly 13- by 6-inch rectangle and brush lightly with water.

Holding 1 rectangle at each end, pick up and transfer to baker’s. (Dough will stretch.) Re-form into rectangle and dimple once more. Jerk peel once or twice; if dough sticks, lift and sprinkle more cornmeal underneath.","Working quickly, mist oven with 4 squirts of water from spray bottle. Line up far edge of peel with far edge of stone and tilt peel, jerking it gently to start dough moving. When edge of dough touches stone, quickly pull back peel to transfer dough to stone.
