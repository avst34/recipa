Once, when director, screenwriter (When Harry Met Sally), and novelist Nora Ephron was in town, she stopped by the dahlia Bakery and bought a few of these cookies. Later she e-mailed me, saying this was her all-time favorite and asked for the recipe. Naturally, I sent it to Nora along with a big package of cookies. When I asked Nora if I could name the cookie after her in my cookbook, she said, \"Are you kidding me? This may be the greatest cookie ever ever ever.\"\nA sandwich cookie takes more effort than a drop cookie, because you have to make both cookies and filling. In addition, this recipe involves a chilling step and requires the cookies to be double-panned. But the results are worth it for the best-textured peanut butter cookie with the creamiest peanut filling.\nAfter arranging the scoops of cookie batter on a baking sheet, slip another baking sheet underneath to double-pan so the cookies bake more slowly and evenly. Since you can bake only eight cookies per baking sheet, and the cookies must be double-panned, you'll have to bake them in batches. Be sure to let the baking sheets cool thoroughly before reusing them.\nWe use two different peanut butters in this recipe. Skippy creamy peanut butter makes the filling smooth and creamy. Adams crunchy peanut butter, which like other natural peanut butters must be well mixed before using to incorporate the oil, has just the right almost-runny consistency and crunchy bits of peanuts to give the cookies the perfect texture. To re-create our peanut butter sandwich cookies, we suggest you use the same or similar brands. We prefer moist brown sugar from a resealable plastic bag rather than from a box.\nThis recipe requires a 2-hour or longer chill of the shaped cookie dough, so plan accordingly.\nThe amount of salt in the filling is a perfect balance to the creamy peanut butter, but if you are substituting table salt for the kosher salt called for in the recipe, be sure to cut the amount in half.\nThis recipe was inspired by the Bouchon Bakery.","hed":"Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies, aka \"The Nora Ephron\"","pubDate":"2012-11-06T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Tom Douglas"},{"name":" Shelley Lance"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/peanut-butter-sandwich-cookies-aka-the-nora-ephron-51129000","photoData":{"id":"54b0515afca98987608afa9b","filename":"51129000_sandwich-cookies_1x1.jpg","caption":"Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies, aka \"The Nora Ephron\"","credit":"Ed Anderson","promoTitle":"Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies, aka \"The Nora Ephron\"","title":"Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies, aka \"The Nora Ephron\"","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cookies","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.39,"ingredients":["electric Mixer, 1-ounce ice Cream scoop (optional but recommended for the most uniform cookie sandwiches)","","1 1/2 cups (14 ounces/400 grams) creamy peanut butter, such as Skippy","6 tablespoons (3/4 stick/3 ounces/168 grams) unsalted butter, softened","2 tablespoons powdered sugar","2 tablespoons honey","1 teaspoon kosher salt","1 1/2 cups (8 ounces/227 grams) all purpose flour","1 teaspoon baking soda","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","1 2/3 cups (5 1/4 ounces/99 grams) rolled oats, such as Quaker old fashioned","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons/11 1/4 ounces/320 grams) unsalted butter, softened","1/3 cup (3 1/2 ounces/125 grams) crunchy natural peanut butter, such as Adams, well mixed","3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces/150 grams) granulated sugar","2/3 cup (5 1/4 ounces/150 grams) packed brown sugar","2 large eggs at room temperature","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"],"prepSteps":["1.

Arrange 8 cookies, spaced evenly apart and staggered, on each parchment-lined baking sheet. (Note: Do not flatten the cookies; they will flatten as they bake.)

There she was, listening to the radio, whistling (she is a formidable whistler) and rolling cream cheese dough around raisins and nuts to form the crescent-shaped cookies known as rugelach. I was spellbound—I'd had no idea that rugelach could be made at home. As far as I knew, rugelach, like ketchup or ships-in-bottles, were only made in laboratories. But here was my mother-in-law shaping the cookies with ease. And a short time later, there I was, eating them with ease. These cookies weren't like the rugelach my mother bought every week at the local German bakery—they were much better. I was so excited I asked for the recipe.\nMy mother-in-law wrote it out in her precise hand on a 3-x-5 index card. And, as she wrote, she told me that this recipe was not exactly the same as the one her mother used, that it had come from Mrs. Strauss, her next-door neighbor, and that she was sure I'd have no problem making the cookies as long as I didn't overmix the dough.\nShe was right. I was a newcomer to the world of baking, but I had no problem with the dough, the only potentially tricky part of the process.\nSince then, I've made rugelach countless times, but nowadays my dough is even more foolproof because I make it in a food processor. I've also made a few other changes to the recipe. While my mother-in-law's rugelach were filled with cinnamon-sugared nuts, mine also include a slick of jam, some currants and a handful of chopped chocolate. This is a very old recipe, and I have no doubt that everyone who has made it has added or subtracted a little bit to make it her own—and my mom-in-law, Mrs. Strauss, and I expect you to do the same.","hed":"Rugelach","pubDate":"2012-10-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Dorie Greenspan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rugelach-51127400","photoData":{"id":"5604013108929a1609a1e672","filename":"51127400.jpg","caption":"Rugelach","credit":"&copy; Alan Richardson","promoTitle":"Rugelach","title":"Rugelach","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["4 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into 4 pieces","1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces","1 cup all-purpose flour","1/4 teaspoon salt","2/3 cup seedless raspberry jam, apricot jam or marmalade","2 tablespoons sugar","1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/4 cup chopped nuts (I prefer pecans, but you can use walnuts or almonds)","1/4 cup plump, moist dried currants","4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped, or 2/3 cup store-bought mini chocolate chips","1 large egg","1 teaspoon cold water","2 tablespoons sugar, preferably decorating (coarse) sugar"],"prepSteps":["Let the cream cheese and butter rest on the counter for 10 minutes-you want them to be slightly softened but still cool.","Put the flour and salt in a food processor, scatter over the chunks of cream cheese and butter and pulse the machine 6 to 10 times.
