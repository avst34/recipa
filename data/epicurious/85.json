It's simple but tasty, and the kind of thing you could easily rustle up for yourself or friends.

Most of the slices will still have a bit of stem still attached and that's good.","Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat in the largest skillet you have. Working in batches, brown the cauliflower slices on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking pan.","Season the cauliflower with salt and pepper, transfer to the oven, and roast until tender, about 15 minutes.","Meanwhile, add the prunes, chopped peanuts, and onion puree to the quinoa and gently heat through, stirring.

This stew wraps itself around your soul and squeezes ever so gently. And while it truly embodies the concept of a one-pot meal, we do like to roast the vegetables separately so they retain their individual flavor, creating even greater depth of flavor.","hed":"Red Wine-Braised Short Rib Stew with Potatoes, Carrots, and Mushrooms","pubDate":"2016-01-03T20:30:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Katherine & Ryan Harvey"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/red-wine-braised-short-rib-stew-with-potatoes-carrots-and-mushrooms","photoData":{"id":"565dcfe8a1deff4e07136991","filename":"Braised-Short-Rib-Stew_6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Christopher Testani","promoTitle":"","title":"Braised-Short-Rib-Stew","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"source","name":"HarperCollins","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon ghee or olive oil","3 pounds boneless short ribs, trimmed","1 tablespoon sea salt","1 onion, peeled and chopped","1 carrot, scrubbed and chopped","1 celery stalk, chopped","1 cup port or red wine","6 sprigs fresh thyme","4 whole garlic cloves","2 cups Beef Bone Broth","Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for serving","2 potatoes, diced","2 carrots, peeled and diced","8 shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps chopped","1 tablesepoon ghee or olive oil","1 teaspoon sea salt"],"prepSteps":["Prepare the short ribs: In a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat the ghee or olive oil.","Pat the short ribs dry with paper towels and season with the sea salt.
