Lanza's witches were Italian, but other countries from Croatia to France to the chilly Teutonic regions equally claim greenwalnut liqueur as their own. I learned to make it at the Institute of Domestic Technology, a cooking school in Altadena, California, where I also teach.\nWhen you harvest the nuts—working barefoot, according to some folklore—they are smaller than eggs, smooth to the touch, and crisp like apples, because the shells have not yet hardened. The nutmeats, at this stage, are jelly.\nLike most liqueurs, nocino is easy but requires patience. You slice the nuts and cover them with strong booze, sugar, and spice, and allow the mixture to infuse for forty days, until it is nearly black. The real test of patience begins after you bottle it. Ten-year-old nocino is said to be the best, and certainly you would never drink this summer's batch before cold weather sets in this fall. Mature nocino has a complex flavor of nutmeg, allspice, coffee, and caramel. Drink it neat as a digestif, or use it to flavor desserts. A few tablespoons of nocino lightly whisked into a cup of heavy cream will cause it to seize, as if magically transformed into cooked custard. The thickened cream is called \"posset,\" and can be used as a sauce alongside cakes or other desserts.\nMy nocino recipe is based on those from the Institute of Domestic Technology and Lanza's Sicilian cookbook The Garden of Endangered Fruit. Its fundamentals are green walnuts, 80-proof grain spirits, and sugar. (My secret ingredient is coffee beans.) You can change the aromatics if you like, but use small quantities, because the spices can take over. Green walnuts are sometimes available at farmers' markets, or can be ordered online at www.localharvest.org.","hed":"Nocino","pubDate":"2013-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Kevin West"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/nocino-51190630","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Alcoholic","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 pounds green English walnuts, 1 1/2 inches or less in diameter (about 30)","750 milliliters 80-proof vodka","3 1/2 cups sugar","Zest of 1 lemon, in strips","Zest of 1 orange, in strips","5 cloves","1/4 whole nutmeg","1 heaping teaspoon whole dark-roast coffee beans"],"prepSteps":["1.

Technique matters also, and a sound recipe makes a difference. But the crucial remaining factor is organization. Especially when dealing with a large quantity of perishable fruits or vegetables, you have to think through your strategy and plot out your work. If you can't get everything put up immediately, you have to take into account how the produce will ripen—and soon fade—as it waits for you.\nMy strategy for how to use a bushel of peaches would look something like this:\nFirst day/underripe fruit: Pectin levels peak just before ripening, so I'd start with peach jelly. If you don't want to make jelly, give the peaches another day to ripen.\nFirst day/just-ripe fruit: Peaches that are fragrant and slightly yielding but still firm enough to handle are ideal for canning in syrup, as either halves or slices in syrup.\nSecond day/fully ripe fruit: As the peaches become tender and fragrant, make jam.\nThird day/dead-ripe fruit: By now, the peaches will likely have a few brown spots that will need to be cut away, so I'd work up a batch of chutney, which requires long, slow cooking that breaks down the fruit anyway.\nFourth day/tired fruit: Whatever peaches haven't been used by now will likely look a little sad, but even really soft, spotty ones can be trimmed for a batch of spiced peach butter.\nSouthern peach chutney evolved from an Indian relish called chatni that British colonials brought home during the days when the sun never set on the Empire. According to The Oxford Companion to Food, chatni is made fresh before a meal by grinding spices and adding them to a paste of tamarind, garlic, and limes or coconut. Pieces of fruit or vegetable may be incorporated, but the chief flavor characteristic is sour. The British turned that into a fruit preserve, explains the Oxford Companion: British chutneys are usually spiced, sweet, fruit pickles, having something of the consistency of jam. Highest esteem is accorded to mango chutney… .\nChutney later spread across the Atlantic to the West Indies and the American South, where the esteemed mango was replaced by the honorable peach.","hed":"Peach or Nectarine Chutney","pubDate":"2013-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Kevin West"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/peach-or-nectarine-chutney-51190820","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Condiment/Spread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["5 pounds yellow peaches or nectarines, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes","3 cups organic or turbinado sugar","2 cups apple-cider vinegar","3/4 cup raisins","1 cup chopped Vidalia onion","1 sweet banana pepper or 1/2 yellow bell pepper, diced","2 or 3 fresh green jalapeños, diced, or adjust to taste","2 cloves garlic, minced","2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root","2 teaspoons freshly grated turmeric, or 1/2 teaspoon ground","4 tablespoons mustard seeds","1 teaspoon garam masala (a ground spice mixture containing pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, nutmeg, cumin, and star anise)","2 teaspoons Darjeeling tea (or 4 tea bags)"],"prepSteps":["1.

The potato chips are layered throughout yet still retain their firm texture. (You don't even need to add salt to the eggs, because the potato chips provide the seasoning.) You can enjoy this warm or at room temperature, with sour cream on the side. Or if you're a ketchup-on-your-eggs person, use the San Marzano ketchup. (After I came up with this dish, I saw similar versions done by José Andrés and Ferran Adrià. A good idea is a good idea no matter how many people come up with it.)","hed":"Potato Chip Omelet","pubDate":"2013-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Richard Blais"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/potato-chip-omelet-51190640","photoData":{"id":"55f9d66c3c346243461d4f8e","filename":"51190640_potato-chip-omelet.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by John Lee","promoTitle":"","title":"51190640 potato-chip-omelet.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Egg","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["12 large eggs","3 tablespoons heavy cream","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","1 tablespoon minced fresh chives","6 cups plain kettle-cooked potato chips","2 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegetable oil"],"prepSteps":["1.
