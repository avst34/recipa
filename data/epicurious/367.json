As the chips bake, the anchovy melts into the potato for an intense one-bite amuse. While no one would want to eat a bowl of these chips, a single one packs a flavor punch. I was inspired to make these by David Bouley, the brilliant chef-owner of Bouley Bakery and Danube in New York, who was a guest chef at Tru soon after it opened in 1999. He wove an anchovy between potato slices and fried them. I was hooked and had to develop my own method, which is to thread a white anchovy through slits in a potato slice and then bake the chips in a hot oven until lightly browned.

Season the steaks liberally all over. Place a heavy skillet over high heat and brush the steaks with a little olive oil. Lay the steaks in the skillet when it is hot and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Turn and cook on the other side for 3 minutes (you may need a minute or two longer if the steaks have been cut from a thicker section of the thigh). You should have a nice brown crust, while the meat inside should be rare. Remove to a plate and rest in the warm oven for 6 to 8 minutes.","Meanwhile, cook the escarole. Place a wide pan over medium-low heat. Add the butter and let it just melt, then add the torn leaves and seasoning. Put the lid on until the water clinging to the leaves begins to steam, then uncover and stir every few seconds so the leaves wilt uniformly. This will take 2 to 3 minutes. Now you should have a lovely glossy, pale green vegetable. Check the seasoning. Place a steak on each warm serving plate and arrange the escarole alongside. Spoon over the picada and serve at once."],"reviewsCount":1,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a4259e6529d92b2c00b381","dek":"Kale goes by another name, one much more dashing, especially in Italian. Cavolo Nero, black cabbage, may not evoke superhero status, but it's close. Kale does seem invincible and it's known to make the eater more so, too. It's also called dinosaur kale (also called lacinato), maybe because its leaves look like the back of a lizard. Those thin knobby leaves squeak. Do not confuse cavolo, accent on the first syllable, with cavallo, accent on the second, or you'll be ordering black horse, and in certain parts of the world will find it. Hearty and good for the spirit. I like soaked and cooked cannellini better than canned ones.","hed":"Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup","pubDate":"2011-03-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Frances Mayes"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/zuppa-di-cavolo-nero-cannellini-e-salsicce-kale-white-bean-and-sausage-soup-363386","photoData":{"id":"56098f37e0acd286555d3859","filename":"363386_hires.jpg","caption":"Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup","credit":"","promoTitle":"Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup","title":"Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.53,"ingredients":["2 Italian sausages, skins removed and meat crumbled","4 tablespoons olive oil","2 onions, chopped","2 garlic cloves, minced","2 quarts chicken stock","1 cup white wine","6 thyme sprigs","1 bunch of kale, washed and chopped","4 cups cooked cannellini beans"],"prepSteps":["Sauté the crumbled sausage in the oil until browned, and reserve.

Then, before serving, make sure to let the pears cool until they are just warm or room temperature. The flavor and texture is much richer once they've cooled. In fact, these pears are perfect for a dinner party or an event where food may be sitting out for a bit; the flavor actually gets better as they rest. Keep in mind the cooking time may vary depending on the variety of pear you use. Some are considerably firmer than others, so if the pears don't seem cooked enough after the suggested cooking time below, continue roasting them until they're very tender. It could take up to an additional half-hour if you get a really firm variety.","hed":"Ready for Guests Roasted Pears","pubDate":"2011-03-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Devin Alexander"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ready-for-guests-roasted-pears-363390","photoData":{"id":"56098f386a59cdb91b5f7922","filename":"363390_hires.jpg","caption":"Ready for Guests Roasted Pears","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Ready for Guests Roasted Pears","title":"Ready for Guests Roasted Pears","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fruit","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["Butter-flavored cooking spray","2 firm pears (about 6 ounces each), rinsed","2 teaspoons light butter, melted (stick, not tub; I used Challenge Light)","2 tablespoons brown sugar, not packed","2 pinches cinnamon"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Raspberries or loganberries are the traditional fruits, but any soft fruit can be used. Likewise, Scottish pinhead oats are best here, but the similar steel-cut oats will work too.
