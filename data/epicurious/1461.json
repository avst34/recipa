Reserve the remaining flour mixture. Let the chicken stand in one layer on a wire rack for 15 minutes.","In a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat 1 inch of the oil to 375°F. and in it fry half the chicken for 1 minute on each side. Reduce the heat to moderate so that the temperature of the oil is reduced to 300°F., fry the chicken, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is cooked through, and transfer it with tongs to paper towels to drain. Keep the chicken warm while frying the remaining chicken in the same manner. Dredge the onions in the reserved flour mixture, shaking off the excess, and in the skillet fry them in 375°F. oil, turning them carefully, for 5 minutes, or until they are lightly golden. Transfer the onions with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sprinkle them with salt to taste. Mound the onions in the middle of a large platter and arrange the chicken around them."],"reviewsCount":6,"willMakeAgainPct":86}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:51:16.891Z","count":1944,"number":1461,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1462&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1460&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
