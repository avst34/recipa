We count on him to bring a loaded basket of his impossibly crisp specialty to our homecoming reunion held annually on the shaded grounds next to the Elderville cemetery, where many of our relatives are buried. But Roger Glenn didn't show up last year, and we were just a touch put out.\n\"We tell 'em we don't care if he comes, we just want his chicken,\" says Cousin Vera. But Roger got the dates mixed up and scheduled some sorry old hunting trip instead, so we all had to suffer.\nRoger's chicken is so good that Vera and her sisters Barbara and Gloria always toss one of his chicken legs over the fence and onto the grave of their dear deceased brother Vance Mitchell, who died eight years ago. Before his death, Vance made it known that even after he was gone, he just might crave another bite of chicken. Every year his sisters make sure that he gets one. Always one to think ahead, Cousin Vance also carefully selected his future gravesite.\n\"Vance said, 'I want mine right here, near the barbecue pit, where all the food is going to be,'\" recalls Vera.\nI missed Roger's chicken so much last year that as soon as I got home from our reunion, I set about figuring out how to replicate it. I already had a few things to go on: He once told me he marinates his chicken in buttermilk. I'd also heard he's a devoted double-dipper—dredging the chicken in flour twice with a dip in the buttermilk marinade in between. It makes the chicken super-crispy. I'm pleased with how my version turned out. If Uncle Roger doesn't show up next year, at least we won't be grumbling about missing his chicken.","hed":"Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken","pubDate":"2010-03-12T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rebecca Rather"},{"name":" Alison Oresman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/double-dipped-buttermilk-fried-chicken-358138","photoData":{"id":"54b2fd473edeef84363b602b","filename":"358138_buttermilk-fried-chicken_1x1.jpg","caption":"Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken","credit":"Laurie Smith","promoTitle":"Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken","title":"Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.24,"ingredients":["4 cups buttermilk","1/2 tablespoon dried thyme","2 tablespoons Tabasco sauce","2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce","2 tablespoons kosher salt","2 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper","2 frying chickens (about 3 pounds each), cut up","3 cups all-purpose flour","1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning","Olive oil or vegetable oil, for frying"],"prepSteps":["Combine the buttermilk, thyme, Tabasco, Worcestershire, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pepper in a nonreactive bowl large enough to contain all of the chicken pieces with at least 1 inch to spare.

Serve immediately or at room temperature (don't let the chicken sit more than 2 hours).","The chicken can be fried up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated. Serve it cold-a classic Texas picnic food-or reheat on wire racks set on baking sheets in a 375°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.","If the chicken looks pretty dark before it is cooked through, transfer to wire racks set on baking sheets and bake in a 375°F oven until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 180°F on an instant-read thermometer.
