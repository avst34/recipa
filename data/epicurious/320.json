The good news is that while it's supermarket-friendly—not hard to find ingredients—it tastes remarkably more complex and nuanced than the short ingredient list would lead you to believe.

That alone is a huge time-saver. To enliven the corn bread, she balances the flavor punch of chorizo with the sweetness of onions and corn kernels. When it comes time to bake it in a dish (not inside the turkey), she forgoes the old process of covering the stuffing—which allows steam to soften the dried bread—because the bread isn't dry.

You can keep your squashes and artichokes, your fennel and snow peas, your kohlrabi and endive just as long as I have my potatoes. After all, according to A. A. Milne, \"If a fellow really likes potatoes, he must be a pretty decent sort of fellow.\"\nBut what's so good about potatoes? In a word: versatility. Once you think you know every way that you can cook a potato, another one comes along, and the Swiss rösti stretches the possibilities of the mighty tuber even further. I fell in love with its great blend of 'tato textures: crispy on the inside, creamy in the middle, it makes an ideal hungover breakfast with poached eggs on top.\nThe best way to prepare the potatoes is to boil them in their skins the night before and place them, unpeeled, in an airtight container in the fridge, for use up to 24 hours later. But if you haven't been able to organize this, just leave them to cool down for at least 30 minutes before grating them.\nA word of warning: watch those shaky hands with wobbly poached eggs!","hed":"Swiss Rösti and Poached Eggs","pubDate":"2011-11-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Milton Crawford"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/swiss-rosti-and-poached-eggs-369310","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Egg","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 1/4 lb white potatoes (about 4 medium to large spuds)","2 garlic cloves, finely minced","Salt and black pepper","1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter","Glug of olive oil","4 free-range eggs","1 tsp white wine vinegar, for poaching egg"],"prepSteps":["Scrub the potatoes and place them, with their skins still on, in a large pan filled with cold, salted water.
