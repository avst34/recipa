However, Vidalias can only be grown in a 20-county production area in and around Vidalia, Georgia, to legally wear the Vidalia label. Because of their thin, tender skins and relatively high sugar content, Vidalia onions are more perishable than most and need to be consumed within about one week of purchase. Look for Georgia-grown Vidalias at farmers markets around the Southeast in early spring through the summer.\nAlthough a regular white sweet spring onion would make a fine substitute, Vidalia's signature sweetness is gorgeous with the saltiness of bacon and the mild, lemony bite of fresh thyme in this savory tart.

Slightly tart green tomatillo sauce is preferred in Mexico City, Jimmy Shaw's hometown, and is very simple to make. Chilaquiles are most commonly eaten at breakfast time (not uncommonly as a hangover cure). Unlike nachos, chilaquiles are a meal to be eaten with a fork. Nothing is wasted in the Mexican home, so this dish was born as a clever way to revive yesterday's tortillas and leftover salsa. At ¡Lotería! you can ask for chilaquiles to be topped with a fried egg, frijoles negros, or shredded chicken or beef. If frying your own tortilla chips seems too involved (I recommend you try it, though—it's really very easy!), as a shortcut, this dish can be made with store-bought tortilla chips, but choose an unsalted variety.","hed":"Chilaquiles Verdes","pubDate":"2009-08-27T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"JoAnn Cianciulli"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chilaquiles-verdes-354951","photoData":{"id":"5609a60d6a59cdb91b5ff614","filename":"354951_hires.jpg","caption":"Chilaquiles Verdes","credit":"Karl Petzke","promoTitle":"Chilaquiles Verdes","title":"Chilaquiles Verdes","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.08,"ingredients":["8 medium tomatillos (about 1 1/2 pounds total weight), husked and rinsed","1 serrano or jalapeño chile, stemmed","1/2 white onion, halved again","2 garlic cloves","1/2 bay leaf","Pinch of dried oregano","Pinch of dried thyme","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth","1 tablespoon corn oil","Vegetable oil for frying","12 6-inch corn tortillas","2 large eggs, beaten","1/2 cup shredded Monterey jack cheese","2 tablespoons crumbled queso fresco or mild feta cheese","3 tablespoons finely chopped white onion","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro","Crema fresca or sour cream for garnish"],"prepSteps":["To make the salsa verde: Put the tomatillos, chile, onion, and garlic in a medium pot and add water to cover.
