She worked very hard at her job managing restaurants while raising five boys and a daughter as a single mother. She loved to have cookies on hand at the end of the day, and she especially loved the Keebler pecan sandie. It was part of my childhood, and it's a flavor combination, vanilla and pecan, that I associate with her. It was an adult cookie to me. There was always a bag of them in the cupboard.\nOr almost always. We were six kids, and we were voracious. That was a problem when it came to my mother's cookies. We had our own cookies, Oreos and Nutter Butters, but when we'd dispatched those, there would be that bag of Mom's pecan sandies, daring us. It was really hard. Those cookies were sacrosanct, but sometimes, guiltily, we ate her cookies, one by one, until they were gone.\nMom had very few things she could call her own. She had no real luxuries. We didn't have winter family vacations; we didn't go to a cabin by a lake in the summer. She worked, and she gave us everything we wanted and needed. But we didn't appreciate it then. How could we know? How could I, youngest of the boys, know?\nBut I do now. Day after day, year after year, Mom set an extraordinary example for me. An example of hard work, attention to detail, and an all-consuming love for our family that I still have today.\nFood is a powerful connecter of who we are to who we were, to our past, to our memories, and, for me, to a different and simpler time. Even the smallest thing—a cookie—can help us understand what we feel now while reminding us of what we once felt and who we've become versus who we were then. So much of who I am today is tied to who my mom was, the choices she made, the way she worked, and how she lived her life. What success I have today, I owe to her.\nAll of which is why the pecan sandie is so important to me.","hed":"Pecan Sandies for My Mom","pubDate":"2012-11-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Thomas Keller"},{"name":" Sébastien Rouxel"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pecan-sandies-for-my-mom-51133200","photoData":{"id":"56040132c301a9f945f0614a","filename":"51133200.jpg","caption":"Pecan Sandies for My Mom","credit":"Deborah Jones","promoTitle":"Pecan Sandies for My Mom","title":"Pecan Sandies for My Mom","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cookies","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1.67,"ingredients":["1 3/4 cups + 1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour (250 grams)","3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans (80 grams)","6 ounces (170 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature","3/4 cup + 1 3/4 teaspoons powdered sugar (90 grams)","Additional powdered sugar for dusting (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Position the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F (convection) or 350°F (standard).
