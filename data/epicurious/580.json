Both rubs are great for slow-cooking and smoking brisket. You only need to make one rub to make this brisket so just pick whichever is more appealing to you.\nBe sure to purchase an untrimmed brisket. The meat needs all of the fat cap to keep it moist during the long cooking time.","hed":"Slow-Cooked Texas Beer Brisket","pubDate":"2008-04-14T20:36:35.000Z","author":[{"name":"Elizabeth Karmel"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/slow-cooked-texas-beer-brisket-242260","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["1 (7 to 9 pound) beef brisket, untrimmed","1/2 cup Lockhart Dry Rub , Tricked-Up Brisket Rub , or favorite barbecue rub","1 bottle beer","Post oak or oak wood chips, soaked in water for 30 minutes"],"prepSteps":["Grilling Method: Indirect/Medium-Low Heat","Sprinkle brisket liberally with the rub of your choice.","Set-up grill for indirect cooking and place smoker box in gas grill if using.
