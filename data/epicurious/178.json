Who would have thought that curry powder would be the perfect addition to a Caesar dressing? Not me before I took the risk of adding it—but now I am a total convert. And the nutritional yeast gives this dressing a cheese-like flavor that could please even the most omnivorous Caesar salad connoisseur.

I am inspired to make it whenever I am prepping lots of veggies, and I realize that what I have left over—the tops of four leeks, three parsnip stubs, carrot peels and tips, and a pile of parsley stems—is almost everything I need to make a great stock. When faced with the decision to capture these flavors so they can become the foundation for future delicious soups, stews, or beans, versus adding them to my compost pile, I try to choose the former. Once you experience how much better your recipes turn out with homemade stock (not to mention how much money you save and how many cartons you keep out of the trash), youll get more motivated. I usually keep a bag in the fridge where I save my veggie scraps, and when it gets big enough, I set my pot on the stove. The recipe below is simple and easy. You can also add corncobs, potato skins, mushroom bottoms, and even tomatoes. If you have a huge stockpot, as I do, you can easily double or triple this recipe. I keep as much stock in the refrigerator as I plan to use within 5 days and freeze the rest. —Myra","hed":"Easy Vegetable Stock","pubDate":"2014-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Myra Goodman "},{"name":" Marea Goodman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/easy-vegetable-stock-51236010","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 large onion (or more), cut into 1- to 2-in/2.5- to 5-cm chunks (or 3 leeks, thickly sliced)","2 to 4 garlic cloves, cut in half (no peeling necessary)","2 to 6 celery stalks (tops OK), cut into 2- to 4-in/5- to 10-cm pieces","2 to 4 carrots, cut into 1- to 2-in/2.5- to 5-cm pieces","1 bunch parsley, and more stems if available (stems are especially flavorful)","1 parsnip, chopped into 1- to 2-in/2.5- to 5-cm pieces (optional)","1 tsp whole black peppercorns","2 bay leaves","4 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 tsp dried thyme"],"prepSteps":["In a large stockpot, combine the onion, garlic, celery, carrots, parsley, parsnip, peppercorns, bay leaves, and thyme with 4 qt/3.8 L water.

These brownies are sensational: very chocolaty, moist, and delectable.

Once baked, you should let the brownies cool at least 30 minutes before cutting into them. At this stage they will be warm and gooey.
