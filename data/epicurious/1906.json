We tried both methods and prefer Daguin's; to our tastes, it yielded the perfect degree of doneness. However, we've included both options in the procedure.\nWhole foie gras can vary in size (goose liver tends to be larger than duck). If your foie gras differs from the recipe by more than half a pound, increase or decrease the size of the terrine, the weight (see \"special equipment,\" below), and the seasonings accordingly. If you don't have an oval terrine, you could use a ceramic soufflé dish or a glass loaf pan that's just large enough for the foie gras to fit in snugly.

Traditionally, it's covered with more stuffing and heavily coated with a Mornay sauce (which glazes the roast as it's heated in the oven). In our updated version, we keep the soubise and duxelles separate and arrange them side by side — black contrasting with white — on each veal slice, so the stuffings are visible.
