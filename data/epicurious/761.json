Martinez also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.\nTo read more about Martinez and Oaxacan cuisine, click here.\nMole Negro is the state dish of Oaxaca, the king of moles. It also happens to be the most difficult to make. People pride themselves on their own different touches, and family recipes are passed down as heirlooms. Market stands specializing in moles all proclaim that their version is the best.\nThis recipe is an adaptation of a version made by my friend and culinary mentor Zoyla Mendoza, who has given me such insight into the cooking of the Valley Zapotecs. When she made it for me at her home in Teotitlán del Valle, she first toasted the chiles, nuts, and spices and sent them out to a nearby mill to be ground. Meanwhile, she pounded the tomatoes and other moist ingredients in her big stone mortar, to be combined later with the nut and spice paste. Less sweet than many other versions, her Mole Negro is spicy and intense — I love the sprightly taste of fresh ginger. Increase the amount of clove and thyme in the recipe if you wish. Zoyla used much more of both than I do.\nThough Zoyla's version of Mole Negro is less complex then some, it shows the crucial \"blackening\" feature of most black moles. For years I'd made versions that turned out no blacker than dark red. An offhand remark revealed what I was doing wrong. \"Queman los chiles\" (\"They burn the chiles\"), a Juchitecan woman casually told me when I asked her. My instinct said that it would turn the whole dish bitter, so I'd just been toasting the chiles lightly. But in Oaxaca it is normal to make Mole Negro by first separating the seeds from the dried chiles, then toasting the chiles to an absolute crisp and literally burning — BURNING — the seeds. Zoyla also follows this procedure. The bitterness disappears through soaking and extended cooking.\nBecause the pungent fumes can leave you gasping and call down the wrath of neighbors in city apartment buildings, it is wise to attempt this recipe only if you can do the worst part (burning the seeds) outdoors or with a good exhaust fan going full blast. You should also work out an advance plan for the final grinding of the paste. You can either combine all the ingredients and process them in several batches in the blender or assign part of the task (the chiles, nuts, and spices that Zoyla sent out to the mill) to the food processor. Read the recipe through carefully in advance, and decide which strategy you prefer. (The processor alone will definitely give the wrong texture.)\nThis sauce is popular with enchiladas and shows up in chicken, turkey, or pork tamales. But the age-old way of eating black mole is with boiled turkey. In this country, use turkey parts like wings or drumsticks and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes in a small amount of stock, then finish cooking in the sauce for another 30 to 40 minutes.\nPlease note that when served in this manner with poultry or other meats, the sauce should be thinned to a fairly light consistency. When it is used as a filling, it must be dense and thick.","hed":"Teotitlan-Style Black Mole","pubDate":"2006-05-16T22:12:54.000Z","author":[{"name":"Zarela Martinez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/teotitlan-style-black-mole-232061","photoData":{"id":"57b20844f53fc7235aebf2ea","filename":"teotitlan-style-black-mole.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"teotitlan-style-black-mole.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.57,"ingredients":["4 ounces ancho chiles (see Tips, below)","4 ounces guajillo chiles (see Tips, below)","1 thick slice day-old brioche or challah","1/3 cup pecan meats","1/4 cup blanched almonds","1 large or 2 medium unpeeled onions","4 unpeeled garlic cloves","1 large ripe tomato","4 ounces tomatillos, with husks","2/3 cup (about 3 ounces) sesame seeds","7 tablespoons lard (preferably home-rendered; see Tips, below)","One 6-inch piece canela (see Tips, below)","1/2 bunch or 1 small bunch thyme (about 2 dozen sprigs), or 2 teaspoons dried, crumbled","1/4 cup dried Oaxacan oregano or 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano, crumbled (see Tips, below)","16 whole cloves","14 allspice berries","1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced","1 cup dark raisins","2 to 4 cups homemade chicken stock, or as necessary (see Tips, below)"],"prepSteps":["The day before beginning the sauce, remove the stems and tops from the chiles; carefully shake out and reserve the seeds. Rinse the chiles under cold running water. Spread them out in a single layer where they can dry completely. Let stand until the following day, turning occasionally and checking to be sure not a drop of moisture remains.","Crush the bread to fine crumbs or grind in a food processor. You should have about 1 cup. Set aside.","Preheat oven to 350° F.","Spread the chiles (they must be bone-dry) in one layer on a baking sheet.

Set aside.","On a griddle or in a small cast-iron skillet, heat the reserved chile seeds over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until thoroughly charred and black on all sides, about 5 minutes. (Because of the fumes, this is best done outdoors if you have the means.) You can speed the process by sprinkling a few drops of vegetable oil over the seeds and igniting with a match, standing well back from the flame and taking care to shield your face, clothing, and hair. Place the charred seeds in a bowl, cover with at least 2 cups cold water, and soak for 1 1/2 hours, changing the water twice. Drain and set aside.","Heat a griddle or medium-size cast-iron skillet over low heat. If using 1 large onion, cut it in half crosswise (leaving the skin on). Place the onion, individual unpeeled garlic cloves, tomato (stem side down), and tomatillos (in the husks) on the griddle. Cook, turning frequently. The onion and garlic are done when they are somewhat softened, about 8 minutes for the garlic and 20 to 25 minutes for the onion. The tomato is done when the skin is blackened and blistered all over, about 15 to 20 minutes. The tomatillos are done when they are lightly softened all over, about 10 to 15 minutes. (Handle them delicately so as not to squeeze them and pierce the skin, and turn frequently to avoid scorching.) Remove each kind of vegetable as it is done and set it aside in a separate small bowl.","When the vegetables are cool enough to handle, remove the husks from the tomatillos and peel the rest, making sure to save the juices. If using a large onion cut in half, scrape the black bits off the cut side.","Place the sesame seeds in a medium-size heavy skillet over medium heat and toast just until golden (about 3 minutes), stirring constantly and shaking the pan. Immediately scrape out the seeds into a small bowl to stop the cooking. Set aside.","In a small, heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon lard over medium-high heat until rippling. Add the canela, thyme, oregano, cloves, allspice, nutmeg and ginger. Fry the spices, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Set aside.","In a small skillet, heat another 2 tablespoons lard over medium heat until rippling. Add the raisins and bread crumbs; cook, stirring, until the raisins are puffed and the bread is lightly colored, about 2 minutes. Set aside.","Now you are ready to purée all the ingredients, using either a blender/food processor combination or a blender alone.","If using both machines, place the pecans, almonds, sesame seeds, bread-raisin mixture, ground chiles, and drained chile seeds in the food processor (working in batches as necessary). Process to a smooth purée. Next, place the fried spices, peeled garlic, onion, tomatoes, and tomatillos in the blender and process to a smooth purée. Combine the two mixtures in a large bowl.","If using only a blender, line up all the prepared ingredients next to the machine on the counter, place some of each in the blender container, add a few tablespoons chicken stock, and process until smooth, adding more stock as necessary to facilitate blending. (This method requires great patience; small batches will be well puréed in 1 to 2 minutes while large ones may retain coarse bits of the spices. If thoroughly processed, the mixture will not require sieving, so try not to rush things.) Pour each batch into a bowl as it is done and proceed with the next batch.","In a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons lard over high heat until rippling. Add the purée, all at once, watching for splatters, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until the harshness of the chiles is mellowed, 35 to 40 minutes.","The mole should now be a heavy paste like a thick frosting mixture. It can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 4 to 6 days, or in the freezer for up to 6 months. In either case, it should be thinned before further cooking.

When eaten as a salad, diners tear off a piece of lettuce with some herbs and add to their bowls of rice or noodles, or fold the leaves and herbs into little packets to dip into a sauce.

Pham also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.\nThis recipe originally accompanied Crispy Spring Rolls.\nNuoc cham is a must at every Vietnamese table, no matter what is served. You can use this condiment for dipping meat, seafood and vegetables, and for drizzling on rice. When serving it with steamed meats (such as steamed chicken), I often reduce the water by half so the sauce is more concentrated.\nYou can often determine a family's roots just by looking at and tasting their nuoc cham. If it's clear and dotted with chopped chilies, the cook is probably from the central or northern regions, where a simple and straightforward version is preferred. But if it's diluted with water and lime juice and sweetened with sugar, one can surmise that the cook is from the verdant south.\nAlthough it will keep up to two weeks in the refrigerator, nuoc cham is best when freshly made. I prefer the intense flavor of the tiny Thai bird chilies, but any hot chilies will do.","hed":"Vietnamese Dipping Sauce","pubDate":"2006-05-16T21:12:54.000Z","author":[{"name":"Mai Pham"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/vietnamese-dipping-sauce-232433","photoData":{"id":"57bb32a3b6069b112362e095","filename":"vietnamese-dipping-sauce.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"vietnamese-dipping-sauce.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Vietnamese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.23,"ingredients":["3 Thai bird chilies or 1 serrano chili, or to taste","1 clove garlic, sliced","3 tablespoons sugar","2/3 cup warm water","1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice","5 tablespoons fish sauce","2 tablespoons finely shredded carrots for garnish (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Cut the chilies into thin rings.
