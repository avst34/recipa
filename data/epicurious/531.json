And once it's in the oven, you can forget about it for hours—it's that easy to prepare. This brisket with a south-of-the-border kick is one of my very favorites. The meat actually tastes better to me when it sits overnight so all the flavors have more time to marry. It will hold well for a few days.

We've worked together for a long time; we've spent long nights drinking and talking food; we even traveled through Italy together. He knows his stuff, no doubt. So when he tells me we should try something, I usually listen. But when he started going on about orzo in our opening-menu-planning sessions, I was less than enthusiastic. He loved it when he was a kid, he said. It was so soul-satisfying and delicious, he said. It would make a great side dish on our menu, he said. But I wasn't buying it. I thought orzo was the kind of comfort food you fed to children and invalids: too bland, too soft, too ... boring.\nBoy, was I wrong.\nLuke's take on orzo can definitely qualify as comfort food: it's hearty, warm, and delicious, the kind of thing you can't stop eating. But it's also grown-up and complex: the wild mushrooms give it a rich earthiness, and the orzo has a great mouth-feel. It's sort of like the mushroom risotto of your dreams—only it's way easier. It's a great match with poultry or meat; but as far as I'm concerned, ain't nothing wrong with sitting down to a big heaping bowlful of this stuff all on its own, topped with a handful of Parmigiano-Reggiano.","hed":"Luke's Wild Mushroom Orzo","pubDate":"2008-11-17T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andrew Carmellini"},{"name":" Gwen Hyman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lukes-wild-mushroom-orzo-350821","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Mushroom","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.61,"ingredients":["1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms (about 1 ounce)","1 sprig fresh thyme","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1 small onion, chopped (about 1/2 cup)","1 1/2 cups mixed wild mushrooms (about 4 ounces), washed, dried, and chopped into 2-inch pieces","1 1/2 teaspoons salt","1/4 teaspoon coarse-ground black pepper","2 tablespoons dry vermouth","1 1/2 cups orzo","2 tablespoons butter","1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano","1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh parsley","1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves","1 teaspoon white-truffle oil"],"prepSteps":["1.
