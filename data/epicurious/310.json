Add the brisket to the pot and brown on both sides until crusty brown areas appear on the surface here and there, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer the brisket to a platter, turn up the heat a bit, then add the onions to the pot and stir constantly with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.

Sprinkle with salt and more pepper to taste, then add the garlic and carrot to the pot. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and cook the brisket for 1 1/2 hours.","Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and, using a very sharp knife, slice the meat across the grain into approximately 1/8-inch-thick slices. Return the slices to the pot, overlapping them at an angle so that you can see a bit of the top edge of each slice. The end result should resemble the original unsliced brisket leaning slightly backward. Check the seasonings and, if absolutely necessary, add 2 to 3 teaspoons of water to the pot.","Cover the pot and return to the oven. Lower the heat to 325°F and cook the brisket until it is fork-tender, about 2 hours. Check once or twice during cooking to make sure that the liquid is not bubbling away. If it is, add a few more teaspoons of water-but not more.

Relatively new here, and often available in the specialty foods section of the supermarket, dulce de leche can be used in all sorts of ways, but we like to drizzle it on top of what could be considered the moistest, most delicious cake on the planet (I double-dare you to find a better one). The combination has a perfect salty-sweet thing happening that is like a highly addictive sensory overload. I promise, it will have you coming back for more. If it doesn't, perhaps the crumbled brittle that decorates the top will.","hed":"Rich Chocolate Cake with Salty Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut Brittle","pubDate":"2012-01-23T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Dawn Casale "},{"name":" David Crofton"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rich-chocolate-cake-with-salty-dulce-de-leche-hazelnut-brittle-388651","photoData":{"id":"560400e27bdffb1205b6add5","filename":"388651_hires.jpg","caption":"Rich Chocolate Cake with Salty Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut Brittle","credit":"Iain Bagwell","promoTitle":"Rich Chocolate Cake with Salty Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut Brittle","title":"Rich Chocolate Cake with Salty Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut Brittle","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.82,"ingredients":["1 cup freshly brewed hot coffee","1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder","3/4 cup packed light brown sugar","1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt","2 teaspoons vanilla extract","8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature","1 1/4 cups granulated sugar","2 eggs","1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour","3/4 teaspoon baking soda","1 teaspoon table salt","Hazelnut Brittle","1/2 cup dulce de leche","1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt"],"prepSteps":["1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prepare a 10-inch round cake pan by greasing it with cooking spray and then lining the bottom with parchment paper.","2. To make the cake, pour the hot coffee into a medium bowl and stir in the cocoa powder until it dissolves. Stir in the brown sugar, followed by the yogurt and the vanilla. Stir thoroughly to ensure that all of the ingredients are incorporated.","3. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until light-yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

Let the cake cool completely.","6. In a food processor, pulse the brittle pieces 3 to 4 times until the brittle is powdery.","7. Put the cooled cake on a serving dish. In a microwave-safe dish, heat the dulce de leche on high power for 30 seconds, or until it is just liquid. Spoon the dulce de leche over the cake, and then sprinkle the kosher salt over the dulce de leche. Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of the ground brittle around the outer edge of the cake as a delicious decoration."],"reviewsCount":18,"willMakeAgainPct":94},{"id":"54a421c319925f464b378993","dek":"I love pumpkin pie so much that I've requested it as my birthday \"cake\" every year since I was about thirteen. I happen to have been born in October, so that helps my choice make some sense. I am also fortunate enough to be married to Dave, whom I refer to as a pie guru. The point is, I've eaten a lot of pumpkin pie, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this is the best pumpkin pie ever. If someone feels otherwise, I am ready for a throwdown, because I can guarantee that their version does not have a grainy cornmeal crust and salty, crunchy pumpkin seeds on top. And without those elements, there's just no match.","hed":"Fresh Pumpkin Pie with Salty Roasted Pepitas","pubDate":"2012-01-23T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Dawn Casale "},{"name":" David Crofton"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/fresh-pumpkin-pie-with-salty-roasted-pepitas-388669","photoData":{"id":"5633887b44a01257151e43dd","filename":"388669_hires.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Iain Bagwell","promoTitle":"","title":"Fresh Pumpkin Pie with Salty Roasted Pepitas","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Food Processor","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour","1/4 cup cornmeal","1 tablespoon sugar","1/2 teaspoon table salt","8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces","3 tablespoons ice water","1 large egg yolk","1/2 cup raw pumpkin seeds","1/2 teaspoon table salt","1/4 teaspoon canola oil","1 1/2 cups half-and-half","2 large eggs","1 15-ounce can pumpkin puree","3/4 cup packed light brown sugar","1 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1 teaspoon ground ginger","1/2 teaspoon table salt","Pinch of ground cloves"],"prepSteps":["1. To make the crust, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse 4 or 5 times, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.","2. In a small bowl, mix together the ice water and egg yolk. Add the egg mixture to the food processor, and pulse until the crumbs begin to climb the side of the bowl and hold their shape when pressed together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using your hands—and a little muscle—form the dough into a 5-inch-diameter disk.

Remove the foil and bake for 6 minutes, until the bottom of the crust looks dry and the shell is a very pale golden color. Remove the dish from the oven and let the crust cool. Leave the oven on.","6. To make the pepitas, stir together the pumpkin seeds, salt, and oil in a small bowl. Scatter the seeds onto a small baking sheet and toast in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the seeds are slightly toasted. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pepitas cool.","7. To make the filling, mix together the half-and-half and eggs in a medium bowl. Add the pumpkin puree and mix well. Then add the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cloves, and mix well. The filling will be very runny. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Sprinkle the pepitas on the filling.","8. Bake for 25 minutes.

I'd always been happy with the ones in the red box at the supermarket—until I tried our homemade ones. The difference in texture is immediately apparent. These cookies are less flaky and crumbly than the store-bought version, and they have a great snappy crunch.
