My grandfather opened Seattle's first Italian-food import store in 1903. It was located just a few steps from where my restaurant, Salumi, is now, and it's one of the things that inspired me to get into the business.\n\"The idea behind Salumi was to create a restaurant, deli, and meat factory in one place, just like the salumerias in Italy. We're known for homemade sausages and salami, but we also attract a large lunchtime crowd. Some of the specials, like the meat loaf and frittata, have been in our family for years.

My grandfather had his own restaurant, my husband is a chef, and I'm co-owner of the Mainly Café and Bakery, where I also happen to be the pastry chef. After I've spent all day baking — and tasting — sweets, it's good to go home and make \"real food\" to eat. Because I'm busy, I like dinnertime to be organized. My secret is keeping the pantry well stocked with basics like olive oil, kosher salt, and a variety of pastas and beans.\"","hed":"Egg Ribbon and Parmesan Soup","pubDate":"2004-09-21T20:28:03.000Z","author":[{"name":"Robyn Fuoco"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/egg-ribbon-and-parmesan-soup-230614","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.8,"ingredients":["3 large eggs","3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided","6 cups low-salt chicken broth","3/4 cup tiny pasta (such as acini di pepe or orzo)","Chopped fresh Italian parsley"],"prepSteps":["Whisk eggs and 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese in small bowl to blend.
