Add the broth and the chicken with any juices that have accumulated on the plate, bring the liquid to a boil, and cook the chicken mixture, covered, at a bare simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon to a serving plate, boil the vegetable mixture, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is thickened slightly, and season the sauce with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the chicken and top it with the parsley. Serve the curry with the rice and the chutney.","In a large saucepan bring 5 quarts water to a boil with the salt. Sprinkle in the rice, stirring until the water returns to a boil, and boil it for 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a large colander and rinse it. Set the colander over a large saucepan of boiling water and steam the rice, covered with a kitchen towel and the lid, for 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy and dry."],"reviewsCount":22,"willMakeAgainPct":95},{"id":"54a46f166529d92b2c029055","dek":"","hed":"Essential Chopped Tomato-Serrano Salsa (Salsa Mexicana Classica)","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Rick Bayless"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/essential-chopped-tomato-serrano-salsa-salsa-mexicana-classica-14992","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.64,"ingredients":["12 ounces (2 medium-small round or 4 or 5 plum) ripe tomatoes","Fresh serrano chiles to taste (roughly 3 to 5, 1/2 to 1 ounce total, or even more if you like it really picante), stemmed","A dozen or so large sprigs of cilantro","1 large garlic clove, peeled and very finely chopped (optional)","1 small (4-ounce) white onion","1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lime juice","Salt, about 3/4 teaspoon"],"prepSteps":["Core the tomatoes, then cut in half widthwise and squeeze out the seeds if you wish (it will give the sauce a less rustic appearance).
