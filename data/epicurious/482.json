Our Barbecue Seasoning and Barbecue Sauce have evolved over time, and the versions that follow have benefited from the contributions of countless kin through the years.\nNow that we are passing our family secrets along to you, it's your job to share them with others. We enjoy changing up recipes ans seeing what happens, and we encourage you to do the same. Who knows? You may come up with a secret sauce or rub that's better than our own!\nOf course, the keys to full-flavored barbecue—indeed, one of the keys to any great-tasting dish—are fresh ingredients and spices. Don't be reaching in the back of the cupboard for some tired old tin of paprika. You want great ribs? Start with fresh spices.\nEveryone down South knows that a good grill seasoning (or \"dry rub,\" as it's called in Memphis) begins with paprika. We use the basic paprika that is not labeled \"sweet\" or \"hot.\" The flavor is subtly sweet, rich, and yet mild, so it blends beautifully with grilled meats. Sugar and onion powder provide a sweet and savory counterpoint.\nKeep in mind that you will be cooking over charcoal and hickory (or your preferred wood), which will add tremendous flavor to the meat. For that reason, this seasoning blend is fairly simple and straightforward.\nFor the best flavor, marinate the spice-rubbed meats overnight in the refrigerator, so they can absorb and \"breathe in\" the flavors.","hed":"Neely's Barbecue Seasoning","pubDate":"2009-05-12T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Pat Neely "},{"name":" Gina Neely"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/neelys-barbecue-seasoning-353449","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"special-consideration","name":"Quick & Easy","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups paprika","3/4 cups sugar","3 3/4 tablespoons onion powder"],"prepSteps":["Stir together the ingredients in a small bowl.
