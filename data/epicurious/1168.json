This lemon tart recipe is my husband, Greg's, specialty. Greg and I cook together a lot, which is fun and makes weeknight dinners and cooking for friends easier to manage now that we're starting our own family.\"\nFor a chocolate-fix variation, Sara suggests filling purchased three-inch chocolate tartlet shells with the lemon curd. Or brush melted sweet chocolate over the graham cracker crust before filling. Begin this recipe four hours to one day ahead.","hed":"No-Bake Lemon Cream Tart","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/no-bake-lemon-cream-tart-105707","photoData":{"id":"560ea8807b55306961bff7ac","filename":"105707.jpg","caption":"No-Bake Lemon Cream Tart","credit":"Dasha Wright Ewing","promoTitle":"No-Bake Lemon Cream Tart","title":"No-Bake Lemon Cream Tart","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Citrus","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter","1/4 cup (packed) golden brown sugar","7 whole graham crackers, finely crushed","1/2 cup whole milk","1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin","1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar","1/2 cup fresh lemon juice","2 teaspoons grated lemon peel","2 large eggs","1 1/4 cups chilled whipping cream"],"prepSteps":["Melt 6 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium-high heat.
