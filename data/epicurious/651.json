in the classic recipe from Richard Olney's Simple French Food that inspired this one, two key innovations ensure a moist, incredibly succulent chicken. First, the birds are spatchcocked, meaning they're butterflied and spread flat so that both the white meat and the dark can be perfectly cooked; second, an herbed-ricotta filling is pushed under the skin, puffing slightly during cooking and extending the meat's flavor in a creamy direction. Actually, you'll notice how much we liked the filling — we call for extra to be baked in a separate dish so that everyone gets a helping. The filling becomes a cross between a popover and a soufflé in texture, with oregano and parsley supplying a suggestion of the Provençal countryside.","hed":"Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken","pubDate":"2007-06-19T21:40:58.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ricotta-and-herb-stuffed-chicken-238929","photoData":{"id":"560d99dd7b55306961bf7729","filename":"238929.jpg","caption":"Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken","credit":"Mikkel Vang","promoTitle":"Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken","title":"Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.3,"ingredients":["4 garlic cloves, minced","3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","4 cups whole-milk ricotta (preferably fresh; 2 pounds)","2 large eggs, lightly beaten","1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (2 ounces)","1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano","1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","2 whole chickens (each about 3 1/2 pounds)","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 400°F with racks in middle and lower third.","Cook garlic in oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
