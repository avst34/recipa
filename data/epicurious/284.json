You have to trust me when I tell you it is really not a big deal—just don't tell anyone Persian I said that! All you need to do is to imagine that instead of making rice, you are making pasta. Most of us know how to make pasta; it is probably what you ate every day when you went to college! You are going to cook this rice in boiling water with oil and salt, just like pasta. You are going to wait until the rice is \"al dente\" (when you bite a grain of rice it should still have a white dot in the middle), just like pasta. Do not overcook Persian rice or your reputation as a Persian cook will suffer! And last, you are going to drain it, just like pasta.\nThe difference comes next: Persian rice has one cooking step that pasta doesn't have. Persian rice gets steamed. Think of it this way: since this rice is fancy, it requires a \"spa treatment.\" What is the result when you pamper yourself in a sauna? A new you! What is the result when you treat your rice to a \"spa treatment\"? Each and every grain of rice becomes its own entity and a pearl from heaven! What is the best after-effect of a \"spa treatment\" for a woman? It makes a better wife, a better mother—and a better cook! What is the best after-effect of a \"spa treatment\" for Persian rice? The most scrumptious, crunchy, golden crust: TADIG!\nTo make this rice you will need a colander—and the smaller the openings, the better. You don't want your precious rice to slip out! Also, many Persian cooks wash and soak the rice as if it were dirty laundry…I am sorry, I keep my laundry in the basement and I don't have time for all that soaking, so trust me when I tell you that you don't need to do it!\nThe quantities in the recipe below might seem large, but considering that Persians breathe rice, it goes really fast. If you want to make a smaller quantity, try only 3 cups rice, 8 cups water, 1/4 cup oil, and 1 tablespoon salt. Also, any basmati rice will do. Basmati rice is also available in whole-grain brown; although it is a little stickier, it is absolutely delicious and healthful!","hed":"Persian Steamed White Rice (Chelo)","pubDate":"2012-07-26T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Reyna Simnegar"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/persian-steamed-white-rice-em-chelo-em-51109800","photoData":{"id":"56040114c301a9f945f06126","filename":"51109800_hires.jpg","caption":"Persian Steamed White Rice (Chelo)","credit":"Marina Karassellos","promoTitle":"Persian Steamed White Rice (Chelo)","title":"Persian Steamed White Rice (Chelo)","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["5 cups basmati rice, checked and rinsed","12 cups water","1/2 cup canola oil","3 tablespoons salt","1/4-inch canola oil poured into the bottom of the saucepan","2 tablespoons water","1/4 teaspoon turmeric or powdered saffron (optional, for a more authentic flavor)"],"prepSteps":["1.
