The Pintauro pasticceria still stands at Via Roma, 275, and it is still among the most highly regarded in the city, although some Neapolitans are fond of saying, \"It isn't what it used to be.\" Until Pintauro adopted the French cream puff pastry — pâte à choux, in French—for his bakery's zeppole, only the much cruder kind of zeppole di Natale, or, in dialect, scauratielli. They are made from a dough of only flour and water or flour and milk, with no leavening, not even an egg. After the Christmas zeppole are formed into rings, actually more the shape of an AIDS ribbon, and fried, they are dipped in hot honey. As you might imagine, they are considerably heavier than the bignè form of zeppole, an because they become even weightier and rather indigestible as they stand, they have to be eaten almost as soon as they emerge from their honey bath. These light, eggy bignè, on the other hand, although they are best when just cooled, can be made hours ahead and re-crisped in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes. The dough can be made a day ahead and kept refrigerated.","hed":"St. Joseph's Day Crullers","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Arthur Schwartz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/st-josephs-day-crullers-102825","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.67,"ingredients":["1 cup water","6 tablespoons butter","Pinch salt","1 tablespoon sugar","1 cup all-purpose flour","4 eggs","Oil for frying","Thick pastry cream"],"prepSteps":["1. In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the water, butter, salt, and sugar. Place the mixture over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring a few times. As soon as the liquid begins to boil (and the butter is completely melted), remove the pot from the heat. Add all the flour and stir very well and vigorously, until the mixture comes together as a dough.","2. Return the saucepan to low heat and stir until the mixture is very smooth, glossy, and begins to form a slight film on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. (If using a nonstick pan, there will be no film formed as an indicator.)","3. Break the eggs, 1 at a time, into the dough, and, before adding the next, beat each egg in very well until it is incorporated into the dough and the dough has become smooth again. ( I use a handheld mixer because this is a tight dough and otherwise required considerable strength an stamina to beat it.) When all the eggs have been added, you should have a smooth, thick paste. It may be prepared a day ahead, but the zeppole should be fried within hours before eating them.","4. Cut the parchment paper into 12 4-inch squares.","5. Using a pastry bag or piping tube fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip (#6), pipe 3- to 3 1/2- inch circles of dough onto the parchment squares.","6. In a 10- to 12- inch skillet, heat 1/2 inch of oil to 375 to 380 degrees and fry the zeppole a couple or a few at a time, depending on the size of the skillet. Place the zeppole in the oil with the parchment on the top. Using tongs, remove the parchment paper after about 10 seconds. This will require a little up-and-down jiggling of the paper, and a motion of peeling the paper back and off the frying dough.","The zeppole should not fry very fast. It should take more than a minute for the first side to become a medium golden. Do not let it get fully, deeply golden. You know the temperature is correct if, after turning the zeppole to the second side, the first fried, already golden side starts splitting open. This indicates that the center is cooking and expanding. Let the second side get golden, then turn over to finish the first side. If the temperature is correct — about 375 degrees — the whole process takes 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the zeppole well on absorbent paper before topping with pastry cream and serving.","For the traditional St. Joseph’s day presentation, arrange the zeppole on a serving plate.
