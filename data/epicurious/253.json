who, pray tell, is this exotic culinary adventuress named Bella? My eight-year-old Portuguese water dog. For a long time now, she's loved carrots. She literally comes running every time she hears the carrot peeler come out of the drawer. My husband and I thought, \"Hmm, that's different for a dog,\" and played the approving parents. Recently, she's expanded her palate to sweet potatoes. No sooner do they hit the counter than she's singing and dancing around my feet. I quarter and square off the potatoes and fling the ends at her, and she's been known to get some serious hang time as she leaps for them. Seriously, Air Bud's got nothing on Bella. Maybe she heard about how healthful sweet potatoes are: their natural sweetness is perfectly balanced with high fiber content, slowing the rush of sugar into the bloodstream, which is great for the vascular system, and for mood. My experience says that's true; whenever I make this salad, Bella's awfully happy.","hed":"Bella's Moroccan-Spiced Sweet Potato Salad","pubDate":"2013-02-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rebecca Katz "},{"name":" Mat Edelson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/bellas-moroccan-spiced-sweet-potato-salad-51151400","photoData":{"id":"54b4034bd5e8c3e1070adf95","filename":"51151400_moroccan-sweet-potato-salad_1x1.jpg","caption":"Bella's Moroccan-Spiced Sweet Potato Salad","credit":"Leo Gong","promoTitle":"Bella's Moroccan-Spiced Sweet Potato Salad","title":"Bella's Moroccan-Spiced Sweet Potato Salad","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.7,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1 cup finely diced yellow onion","Sea salt","1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger","1 teaspoon ground cumin","1/2 teaspoon paprika","1 pound orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, such as garnet yams, cut into 1/2-inch cubes","1/2 cup water","1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, preferably blood orange juice","1 teaspoon grated orange zest","1 teaspoon grated lemon zest","2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice","2 teaspoons Grade B maple syrup","12 kalamata olives, cut in half","1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","1/4 cup almonds or shelled pistachios, toasted and coarsely chopped"],"prepSteps":["Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat.

Its scarcity (it takes some four thousand crocus blossoms to create an ounce of saffron) and the belief that it could be used to treat everything from wounds to the plague even caused the Austrians to go to war over the spice during the Dark Ages. This is at least one feudal folk myth that modern science has corroborated. Studies have shown that saffron has outstanding antibacterial and antiviral properties and also aids digestion. People sometimes balk at saffron's cost, but it isn't unreasonable when you consider its potency; this recipe calls for only 1/8 teaspoon, and as you'll see, a little goes a long way. This pilaf is a delightful and gorgeous dish. The rice is sautéed before cooking to avoid that sticky, gummy consistency, and ginger, parsley, and lemon zest add zing.\nPrepare ahead: Soak the rice in cool water and the juice of half a lemon for 8 hours or overnight before cooking; this will make its nutrients more available and decrease the cooking time. If you don't have time to soak the rice, add an extra 1/4 cup of broth and cook for an additional 15 minutes.","hed":"Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger","pubDate":"2013-02-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rebecca Katz "},{"name":" Mat Edelson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/brown-rice-pilaf-with-saffron-and-ginger-51151200","photoData":{"id":"54b40329d5e8c3e1070ade9a","filename":"51151200_brown-rice-pilaf_1x1.jpg","caption":"Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger","credit":"Leo Gong","promoTitle":"Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger","title":"Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Ginger","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.43,"ingredients":["1 teaspoon warm water","1/8 teaspoon saffron","1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","1 tablespoon diced shallot","1 cup brown basmati rice, soaked, rinsed, and drained well","1 3/4 cups water or vegetable broth, homemade or store-bought","1/2 teaspoon sea salt","1 (1-inch) piece unpeeled fresh ginger","1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice","1 teaspoon lemon zest","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley"],"prepSteps":["Combine the warm water and saffron in a small bowl.

The traditional fat used is butter, but other cultures use lard. I propose one very good reason for using schmaltz instead of either: flavor! This is a delicious savory bread that makes superb dinner rolls to serve with chicken or turkey, a simple salad, chicken soup, or anything, really.\nAs far as I'm concerned, this version is out of the park (my assistant Emilia started it, I finished it, Marlene tested it and confirmed). You need to make it the day before you bake it, but it's a really simple preparation. It can be baked free-form, in individual ramekins, or in a loaf or terrine mold. Marlene made nifty \"bubble top\" rolls by filling muffin cups with three 1-ounce/30-gram balls, a technique she picked up from Dorie Greenspan's excellent book Around My French Table. I had my first bite while it was still warm from the oven, with a little extra schmaltz and a sprinkling of Maldon sea salt. Heavenly. If you bake it in a rectangular mold, slice it and toast it, delicious.\nThis from Marlene: \"OK, I want to say I was skeptical of this at the beginning. The dough smelled chickeny, not only while it was rising but also while it was baking. However, these totally rocked. There was no hint of chicken in the taste or the smell in the final product. The crust is the best I've ever produced. It was crisp, almost flaky, like biscuits.

This is a traditional spread to be served on crackers or toast, an easy and inexpensive canapé. It shows off the versatility of the egg, the power of schmaltz to enrich, the forcefulness of the gribenes to flavor, and the power of the onion. Onion and egg, that's it. In its plainest form—egg, sautéed onion, gribenes, schmaltz, salt and pepper—it's good but very plain. Arthur Schwartz's version, chopped by hand and mashed slightly with a fork, is even plainer-eggs, schmaltz, salt and pepper, enlivened with raw onion. That said, its greatness lies in this simplicity.\nLois is going to get a little huffy, but I've fallen back on my habit of giving this a little sparkle with some minced shallot macerated in lemon, a kick with cayenne, a little more depth of flavor with fish sauce, and a nice crunch from some diced celery folded in-but it's up to you. No matter how you make it, it goes great on water crackers, matzo, thinly sliced toast, and would be a great garnish for a green, leafy salad.

And salt of course—sausage needs salt. My optimal salt level is 1.75 percent, so I multiply the weight of the meat (in ounces or grams) by 0.0175 to get that amount of the salt needed (also in ounces or grams). If you like less salt take it back to 1.5%.\nThis seasoning makes a great breakfast sausage as well as an excellent grilling sausage. If you have a sausage stuffer and like to link sausage, by all means stuff this sausage into casing. I like to cook this in patties and cook them either in a sauté pan or on the grill. The schmaltz can be replaced with pork fat or pork belly, if you have access to thighs but not schmaltz, but I think it's most intensely flavored using chicken fat.\nI'm fanatical about keeping sausage fixings cold all the way through the making, and I'm especially crazy about it here, because chicken fat is pourable at room temperature. Thus it's important to keep everything—the fat, the meat, even the seasonings—close to frozen while you're making this. I freeze the fat, cut it in chunks and then grind it frozen. After grinding this can be mixed by hand using a stiff spatula, dough spatula or wooden spoon, but a standing mixer with the paddle attachment works best.
