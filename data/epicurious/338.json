I shopped online and in brew shops for sarsaparilla, sassafras, and the other necessary tinctures and extracts.\nMy first attempt at making a root beer syrup definitely tasted like a \"root\"—pithy, astringent, and even a little peaty. After I made some adjustments, my next batch was closer to the flavor I was striving for, but it was still too strong. A root beer float should tickle the nose, not drain the sinuses.\nI did more research online, visiting blogs by root beer aficionados and bakers alike. According to many of these bloggers, their success was due to one particular ingredient. So I went back to the brew shop, picked up what the experts had recommended, and got down to work. Sure enough, the resulting gobs were delicious, with just the right amount of \"fizzy\" flavor. The secret to success? Premade root beer extract. You can find it in well-stocked grocery stores, shops that cater to home brewers, or online. The extract is easy to use, the flavor is exactly what you hope it will be, and I can honestly say that when paired with vanilla filling, this gob is a total success.","hed":"Root Beer Float Gobs","pubDate":"2011-09-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Steven Gdula"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/root-beer-float-gobs-367629","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda","1 teaspoon salt","2 cups sugar, sifted","8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, cut in 1/2-inch cubes","2 eggs, separated, at room temperature","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature","2 tablespoons sour cream","3 tablespoons root beer extract","8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, cut in 1/2-inch cubes","12 tablespoons cream cheese, cut in 1/2-inch cubes","2 tablespoons vanilla extract","1 large vanilla bean, seeds scraped and reserved","2 tablespoons sour cream","1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice","2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted"],"prepSteps":["1.

But often in West Texas (and also New Mexico) the filling and sauce are instead layered between flat tortillas. They look a bit different, but the end taste is the same, not to mention stacked enchiladas are a heck of a lot easier to make.\nAnother feature of stacked enchiladas is the inclusion of a fried egg on top. I don't know how this tradition came about, but it's a brilliant addition. When the yolk mixes with the sauce, its creamy transformation takes the sauce from merely delicious to truly decadent.\nI was born and raised a rolled-enchilada girl, but I can appreciate a plate of stacked ones, especially those made with an ancho chile sauce. And if I squint, I can see in the stack the rugged terrain of West Texas, with the egg standing in for clouds and the sun.

They're soft, juicy, floral, and sweet, and the best I've ever tasted. During the season, when you travel through lush Hill Country Texas towns such as Fredericksburg, or Central Texas towns such as Fairfield, you won't be able to go a mile without seeing a roadside stand or pickup truck filled with baskets of this cherished summertime treat. We also have a peach tree at my grandma's North Texas farm, and every July it delivers a bounty of peaches that she'll put up for later in the year.\nPickling fruit is a common method of fruit preservation in Texas. Yes, there's vinegar involved, as with other types of pickles. But you also add enough sugar and warm spices to give the fruit a balance of both acidity and sweetness. If you've never tried pickled fruit, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\nPickled peaches are perhaps my favorite fruit to preserve, as I love how the peaches' sweet juice combines with the piquant brine. Of course, I've added a bit of heat to my peaches, which is decidedly not traditional, but I find that the habanero's flowery notes go very well with the peaches' floral tones.\nThese go well with a bowl of ice cream, on top of your morning oatmeal, with a freshly baked biscuit, or yes, simply eaten straight out of the jar.","hed":"Habanero Pickled Peaches","pubDate":"2011-09-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lisa Fain"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/habanero-pickled-peaches-367389","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["3 pounds fresh peaches","1 cup apple cider vinegar","1 cup granulated sugar","1 habanero chile, stem and seeds removed, cut in half","2 cinnamon sticks","1/2 teaspoon whole cloves","2 quart-size jars with lids and bands"],"prepSteps":["1.

If it's cooked in a dish of its very own, it's officially dressing. As it so happens, I like to serve this side with more than just poultry, and I especially love the browned crust, so dressing it is! Two other key factors in delivering dynamic texture are to toast the cubes of tangy sourdough bread first and to use a combination of thinly sliced and coarsely chopped mushrooms. Roasting the mushrooms before mixing with the other ingredients heightens their deep earthy flavor while cooking off any excess liquid. Studded with salty bits of bacon and fresh herbs, this side dish is destined to become a favorite of your Thanksgiving—or any dinner—table.","hed":"Sourdough, Wild Mushroom, and Bacon Dressing","pubDate":"2011-09-02T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bobby Flay"},{"name":" Stephanie Banyas "},{"name":" Sally Jackson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sourdough-wild-mushroom-and-bacon-dressing-367489","photoData":{"id":"54b29abd3edeef84363b0ba9","filename":"367489_sourdough-wild-mushroom-bacon-dressing_1x1.jpg","caption":"Sourdough, Wild Mushroom, and Bacon Dressing","credit":"Ben Fink","promoTitle":"Sourdough, Wild Mushroom, and Bacon Dressing","title":"Sourdough, Wild Mushroom, and Bacon Dressing","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Mushroom","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.89,"ingredients":["Unsalted butter, for the baking dish","1 1/4 pounds sourdough bread, crusts trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 12 cups)","1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and coarsely chopped","1/2 pound oyster mushrooms, coarsely chopped","1 pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced","4 tablespoons canola oil","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","3/4 pound slab bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice","1 large Spanish onion, finely diced","5 cloves garlic, finely chopped","4 to 6 cups chicken stock, homemade or store-bought, as needed","2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage","2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme","1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","2 large eggs"],"prepSteps":["1.

Cubes of tender pumpkin bread are baked in a rich custard laced with bourbon and maple syrup. Crisp apple cider is the base of a buttery caramel sauce spiced with fresh ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise. Forget about serving the same-old pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and put this out instead for a new twist on two old classics. The recipe includes directions for making your own pumpkin bread to use in the pudding, but you can of course also use a loaf of pumpkin bread from your favorite bakery. Brioche or cinnamon-raisin bread would also work perfectly.","hed":"Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce","pubDate":"2011-09-02T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bobby Flay"},{"name":" Stephanie Banyas "},{"name":" Sally Jackson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pumpkin-bread-pudding-with-spicy-caramel-apple-sauce-367511","photoData":{"id":"54b29a3c3edeef84363b08a2","filename":"367511_pumpkin-bread-pudding_1x1.jpg","caption":"Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce","credit":"Ben Fink","promoTitle":"Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce","title":"Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Bourbon","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.84,"ingredients":["Unsalted butter, for the pan","8 cups 1/2-inch cubed Pumpkin Bread or other bread","2 cups heavy cream","1 cup whole milk","1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped","6 large egg yolks","1/2 cup sugar","3 tablespoons pure maple syrup","1 cup canned pumpkin puree, not flavored pie filling","2 tablespoons bourbon","Freshly whipped cream, for serving","Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce","Shelled pumpkin seeds (optional), for garnish"],"prepSteps":["1.

Bar Americain is open each year for Thanksgiving, and we typically serve about six hundred people before the day is over. No matter how many wonderful selections we offer on the abbreviated holiday menu, without fail turkey is the biggest seller—partly because people love it and partly, I think, out of a sense of tradition. This is the turkey that I serve at Bar Americain, with only the dressing and sides changing from year to year. This year I am pairing the all-American bird with all-American ingredients: wild mushrooms and Pinot Noir from the Pacific Northwest, figs from California, cranberries from Maine, bacon from Kentucky, and sweet potatoes from Georgia.","hed":"Herb Roasted Turkey","pubDate":"2011-09-02T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bobby Flay"},{"name":" Stephanie Banyas "},{"name":" Sally Jackson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/herb-roasted-turkey-367469","photoData":{"id":"54b299ee3edeef84363b07c0","filename":"367469_herb-roasted-turkey_1x1.jpg","caption":"Herb Roasted Turkey","credit":"Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"Herb Roasted Turkey","title":"Herb Roasted Turkey","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Herb","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.69,"ingredients":["1 (17-pound) turkey, rinsed well and patted dry","10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened","2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","6 cups chicken stock, homemade or store-bought","3 large carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces","3 large stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces","2 large onions, quartered"],"prepSteps":["1.
