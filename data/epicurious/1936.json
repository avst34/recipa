One day, my mother mentioned that she was looking forward to trying a crêpe recipe that she had found. \"Only a French person can teach you how to make crêpes,\" Jackie declared, and the next day she brought in an electric skillet to demonstrate her superlative version for her office mates. My mom knew a good thing when she tasted it, and she promptly appropriated the recipe. When Mom got married, her coworker brought her a crêpe pan from Paris, and it has become beautifully seasoned from nearly 40 years of use. I have many happy memories of weekend brunches, downing six or seven delicious crêpes and fighting with my brother over the last one.\nI also have happy memories of hours spent at my mom's side, watching her pour the batter into that pan and turn it just so. A few years ago, she gave me a pan of my own, and this recipe is now one of my specialties — a favorite request from my boyfriend and our friends. Over time I have experimented, using different liqueurs for flavoring. I still prefer regular brandy, but I have also had great results using two parts bourbon and one part Amaretto, or substituting specialized brandies such as Cognac or fruit-flavored eau-de-vie.","hed":"Breakfast Crepes","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Judy Kagan "},{"name":" Sarah Kagan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/breakfast-crepes-108134","photoData":{"id":"57990894bd7fde737c83776e","filename":"breakfast-crepes.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"breakfast-crepes.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.85,"ingredients":["1 1/2 cups whole milk","3 large eggs","3 tablespoons sugar","1 teaspoon salt","Scant 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted","1/2 cup brandy","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 cup all-purpose flour","Additional butter for cooking","Additional sugar or clear jelly such as apple or apricot for serving","Iron skillet or crêpe pan","Flexible metal or plastic spatula"],"prepSteps":["In a blender, combine milk and eggs.

New Orleans's first po'-boy makers settled on a roll that is light and mild, so that it doesn't overpower the tender oysters inside, yet is substantial enough to keep its shape when the sweet juices are released from their cornmeal crust. We discovered that a soft-crusted French, Italian, Portuguese, or Cuban loaf works well. Hot pepper sauce is the traditional condiment, but we've improvised a little, using chipotle mayonnaise to add a layer of smokiness instead of pure heat.","hed":"Oyster Po' Boys","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/oyster-po-boys-105599","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.7,"ingredients":["1/2 cup mayonnaise","1 1/4 teaspoons minced canned chipotle chiles in adobo","1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice","6 cups vegetable oil","1 large egg","1/4 cup whole milk","2 1/2 teaspoons salt","1 1/2 cups cornmeal","1/4 teaspoon black pepper","2 cups shucked oysters, drained (about 36)","1 (12- to 14-inch-long) loaf soft-crusted bread","3 cups shredded iceberg lettuce","Accompaniment: lemon wedges","a deep-fat thermometer"],"prepSteps":["Whisk together mayonnaise, chipotle, and lemon juice and chill mixture, its surface covered with plastic wrap.","Heat oil in a deep heavy pot (preferably a cast-iron Dutch oven) over high heat until it registers 375°F on deep-fat thermometer, about 12 minutes.","While oil is heating, whisk together egg, milk, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl.
