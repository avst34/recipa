the nights turn blustery and the temperature drops, I know that roasted vegetable season has arrived, and I embrace it with reckless abandon. I'll roast any kind of sturdy vegetable that I can cut up and fit into my oven, but one of my favorites is cauliflower, preferably tossed with whole cumin seeds. Not only does the cumin act as a natural remedy to help reduce the dreaded intestinal gas factor (or so I've been told), but it also adds a pleasant earthy flavor to balance the assertive tang of the vegetable.\nRoasted cauliflower with cumin makes a nice and simple side dish. Even Dahlia will eat it if she's distracted enough. But recently I made it into lunch. I roasted up a head all for myself, and added a topping of salted yogurt (which is simply a good, full-fat yogurt with a little kosher salt mixed in), a few leftover pomegranate seeds (which I can buy at my local market already picked out of the husk), and a smattering of bright green chopped fresh mint. It was a perfect light lunch. It could even be dinner, served over brown rice, bulgur, or some other filling, toasty grain, for a warming meal to start out roasting season right.","hed":"Cumin Seed Roasted Cauliflower with Salted Yogurt, Mint, and Pomegranate Seeds","pubDate":"2011-08-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Melissa Clark"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/cumin-seed-roasted-cauliflower-with-salted-yogurt-mint-and-pomegranate-seeds-367178","photoData":{"id":"54b2a46b11c5d6af478b18fb","filename":"367178_roasted-cauliflower_1x1.jpg","caption":"Cumin Seed Roasted Cauliflower with Salted Yogurt, Mint, and Pomegranate Seeds","credit":"Andrew Scrivani","promoTitle":"Cumin Seed Roasted Cauliflower with Salted Yogurt, Mint, and Pomegranate Seeds","title":"Cumin Seed Roasted Cauliflower with Salted Yogurt, Mint, and Pomegranate Seeds","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"meal","name":"Side","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.43,"ingredients":["1 large head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","Plain yogurt, for serving","Chopped fresh mint leaves, for serving","Pomegranate seeds, for serving"],"prepSteps":["1.

My aim is always the same—to make the dish quickly with a minimum of fuss, and to use a maximum of vegetables that she will tolerate and not pick out.\nThis is one of both our favorites. It's comforting, crusty topped, soft centered, and very cheesy—but not at all sophisticated. Just simple, kid-friendly, homemade food with the added grown-up appeal of lots of healthful carrots tossed into the mix.\nI got the idea from a chef's recipe in a glossy food magazine. The chef called for cooking carrots in butter and orange juice, pureeing them, and using the puree as a sauce for mac and cheese. I tried the recipe as written and was disappointed. It was a lot of work, and I didn't like the sweetness of the citrus fruit interfering with my cheesy goodness.\nSo I decided to come up with my own simplified and ultra-Cheddary version. It was a huge hit with the under-three crowd and their parents, too.\nIt's a straightforward recipe that comes together without much fuss, other than having to grate some carrots. But to make up for that, I've eliminated the need to make a cheese sauce on the top of the stove. Instead, I toss the hot pasta with grated cheddar, butter, sour cream for creaminess, and eggs to hold it all together. The grated carrots get boiled along with the pasta, so cooking them isn't an extra step. And the tiny orange shreds look so much like the cheddar that your kids might not even notice they are there. Dahlia certainly hasn't, and while I've never lied to her about their inclusion, I might have left out the word carrot in the dish description—accidentally, of course.","hed":"Carroty Mac and Cheese","pubDate":"2011-08-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Melissa Clark"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/carroty-mac-and-cheese-367160","photoData":{"id":"54b2a41b3edeef84363b14f2","filename":"367160_mac-and-cheese_1x1.jpg","caption":"Carroty Mac and Cheese","credit":"Color photography by Andrew Scrivani","promoTitle":"Carroty Mac and Cheese","title":"Carroty Mac and Cheese","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Pasta","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.4,"ingredients":["2 cups whole wheat macaroni","2 1/2 cups coarsely grated carrot (about 8 small)","3 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese","1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces","3/4 cup sour cream","1/4 cup whole milk","2 large eggs","1 teaspoon kosher salt","3/4 teaspoon mustard powder","1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","1/4 cup finely grated parmesan cheese"],"prepSteps":["1.
