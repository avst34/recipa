Here, cooked until it's very dark, with a smoky, bitter edge, the caramel balances the milky sweetness of the rice.\nThis is also an unusual pudding in that it forgoes much of the milkiness of the other grain puddings in this chapter. I cook the rice in water, with just a little milk. The liquid is gradually evaporated when the rice is mixed with the caramel, leaving an intensely flavored sauce. This is very rich pudding, but that quality comes almost entirely from the caramel itself—not the dairy.","hed":"Salted Caramel Risotto","pubDate":"2013-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Faith Durand"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/salted-caramel-risotto-51176400","photoData":{"id":"54af4f024074bdfd06839810","filename":"51176400_caramel-risotto_1x1.jpg","caption":"Salted Caramel Risotto","credit":"Stacy Newgent","promoTitle":"Salted Caramel Risotto","title":"Salted Caramel Risotto","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1/2 tablespoon (7 g) unsalted butter","1/2 cup (100 g) short-grain white rice, such as arborio","1 cup (240 ml) whole milk","1 cup (200 g) sugar","1 cup (240 ml) cream","1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","Unsweetened whipped cream, to serve"],"prepSteps":["Toast the rice: Heat 2 cups (480 ml) water.

The first is recent: cold lassi spiked with cardamom, a favorite drink at Indian restaurants. The musky flavor of cardamom just plays well with the tangy, refreshing taste of yogurt. And so does honey, which brings me to my second memory. My mother often served me and my siblings big bowls of plain yogurt with honey swirled in—it was a favorite summer lunch. I remember how the honey laced the yogurt in thick ropes of sweetness. This is a plain yet comforting dish, the two flavors marrying perfectly.\nI bring these three tastes together here in this dish, and finish it all off with fresh summer apricots.
