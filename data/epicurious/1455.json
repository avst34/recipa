If turkey was served at all, it was probably one of many game birds, that were served along with venison, oysters, clams, lobsters, and eels, as well as succotash, beach plums, sweet potatoes, leeks and cornbread. My own Thanksgiving menu is intended to pay homage to the foods of the first Thanksgiving , as well as to the foods that have become associated with this holiday. I believe that holidays by their own nature demand that traditional foods be served. In America, there is no stronger correlation between the food and the day than that of the venerable Thanksgiving Day turkey.","hed":"Roast Vermont Turkey with Giblet Gravy and Sausage and Sage Dressing, for Thanksgiving","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jasper White"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roast-vermont-turkey-with-giblet-gravy-and-sausage-and-sage-dressing-for-thanksgiving-104109","photoData":{"id":"561026a67b55306961bfffcf","filename":"104109.jpg","caption":"Roast Vermont Turkey with Giblet Gravy and Sausage and Sage Dressing, for Thanksgiving","credit":"","promoTitle":"Roast Vermont Turkey with Giblet Gravy and Sausage and Sage Dressing, for Thanksgiving","title":"Roast Vermont Turkey with Giblet Gravy and Sausage and Sage Dressing, for Thanksgiving","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Herb","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.73,"ingredients":["1 Vermont or other fresh turkey, about 10 pounds, fattened on corn and walnuts, killed 3 days earlier","kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","","1 lemon","1/2 apple","1/2 medium onion","10 sprigs fresh thyme","4 branches fresh rosemary","2 branches fresh sage","10 sprigs Italian parsley","4 bay leaves","1/4 cup vegetable oil","trimmings from the turkey","1/2 medium onion","2 stalks celery","1 carrot","2 bay leaves","10 black peppercorns","5 Italian parsley stems","6 tablespoons unsalted butter","1/4 cup all-purpose flour","4 tablespoons all-purpose flour","8 tablespoons unsalted butter","1 teaspoon water","1 large leek, white part only, cut in 1/4-inch dice","3 cups turkey stock","giblets from turkey, finely diced","1 hard-boiled egg, finely diced","salt and freshly ground pepper","","Country Sausage and Sage Dressing","Cranberry Relish"],"prepSteps":["1. Prepare the turkey. Remove all extra parts; reserve giblets. Cut off wingtips and any excess neck, etc. Season turkey inside and out with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper; be generous. Loosen up leg joints without tearing skin.","2. Make the stuffing by roughly chopping the lemon , apple, onion, thyme, rosemary, sage, parsley and bay leaves into 1/2-inch pieces. Mix with oil. Put stuffing into cavity and truss the bird. Do not tie too tight.","3. Start the stock at least 30 minutes before roasting the turkey. Place the wingtips and neck in a saucepan; add 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Skim off any foam. Reduce heat to a slow simmer. Add onion, celery, carrot, bay leaves, peppercorns and parsley stems. Allow to simmer about 2 1/2 hours. Strain stock and reserve.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons flour evenly on the bottom of a roasting pan. Place turkey on a rack in the pan. Allow time for turkey to come to room temperature if it is still cold to the touch.","6. Place turkey in oven. Leave in oven for 40 minutes or until the bird is browned all over. Combine 8 tablespoons butter with 1 teaspoon of water and bring to a boil. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and baste the turkey generously with the butter mixture. Repeat this process twice, once every 10 minutes, until basting liquid is used up. At this point, the turkey should be in the oven about 1 hour. Now baste 2 more times at intervals of 15 minutes, using pan drippings. At this point, the turkey has been in about 1 hour 30 minutes. Cook 20 minutes more without basting, to allow the skin to crisp. Remove from oven. Allow to rest at least 30 minutes before carving. Make the gravy during this resting period.","7. To make the gravy, remove turkey to a serving platter. Place roasting pan directly on top of a burner on medium heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, allowing excess liquid to evaporate. Stir constantly. Now carefully remove any excess fat that has not combined with the flour to make a roux. Add the diced leek and cook for 1 minute. Slowly add 3 cups turkey stock, allowing the gravy to thicken as it comes to a boil. At this point it may be switched to a saucepan. Make sure that every bit of the pan drippings has been incorporated into the gravy. Add the giblets and simmer for about 15 minutes. Stir in the hard-boiled egg and remove from heat.

Braised meats, with their rich flavors, tender texture and intense, reduced sauces, are definitely homey, but you may never have tried to make them at home. They sound as if they might be complicated to prepare—like something best left to a restaurant chef—and what exactly is braising, anyway?\nRelax. Braising is easy—there are only two steps: The meat is browned first, then covered and simmered in seasoned liquid. According to Cory Schreiber, the chef at Portland's super-popular Wildwood Restaurant & Bar, braising is a great way to cook lamb shanks. In the recipe here, he does something slightly unusual: He simmers the shanks uncovered in the oven. That way, he says, \"the dry heat caramelizes the top of the meat—giving it a bit of a crust—which adds nice texture and color.\" The lamb is accompanied by a roasted squash purée and wilted Swiss chard.\nWith this recipe in hand, you can actually have your next homey meal at home. Add a salad and crusty bread, and you've got your first dinner party of the season.\nUse a pot that's at least 12 inches across.","hed":"Braised Lamb Shanks with Winter Squash and Red Chard","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Cory Schreiber"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/braised-lamb-shanks-with-winter-squash-and-red-chard-104042","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Lamb","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.39,"ingredients":["4 3/4- to 1-pound lamb shanks","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter","1 1/2cups chopped onion","1 cup chopped carrots","1 cup chopped parsnips","4 fresh large thyme sprigs","2 whole garlic heads, unpeeled, cut horizontally in half","1 cup dry red wine","5 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth","1 large orange, peel and pith cut away, orange quartered","2 whole cinnamon sticks","2 teaspoons fennel seeds, crushed","1 1 3/4-pound butternut squash, quartered lengthwise, seeded","1/2teaspoon (scant) ground nutmeg","1 fresh medium fennel bulb, trimmed, sliced (about 2 cups)","2 teaspoons grated orange peel","2 bunches red Swiss chard","2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter"],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 375°F.

You will find this in many restaurants in Maine, the best being the ones with the most lobster. I have embellished on the original dish but have left intact the strong and rich lobster flavor. When Craig Claiborne asked me to put together a New England Thanksgiving dinner, this was the soup I served.
