good news for America that grass-fed beef is increasingly available in supermarkets. Cattle were meant to eat grass, and they are efficient at converting that green goodness into nutrient-dense meat, rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamins A and E, to say nothing of environmental benefits. Because grass-fed beef is leaner than grain-fed, it's not quite as tender. So turning it into a meatloaf is a greatand economicalway to make a meal of it.\nA little ground pork adds the bit of richness that all meatloaves need, and if you can persuade the butcher to grind some pork shoulder for you, all the better. Meatloaves look naked without some sort of topping, and bacon is the obvious trendy choice to entice finicky eaters; feel free to aim for high-end bacon from heritage hogs.\nEditors' Note: Kemp Minifie reimagined the foil tray frozen dinner for Gourmet Live.

It's old-fashioned in its use of unsweetened chocolate, yet the addition of cocoa takes it to the deeper, darker chocolate place we crave these days.\nNot everyone loves nuts in their brownie, but without them, brownies seem more like dense squares of chocolate cake. When you do the done test, the toothpick comes out cleanno dilemmas over the moistness of the crumbs clinging to the pickyet when you cut the brownies into pieces, you'll slice through the requisite thin crust to reveal super-moist and fudgy goodness.\nEditors' Note: Kemp Minifie reimagined the foil tray frozen dinner for Gourmet Live.
