Altars dedicated to los difuntos (\"departed ones\") appear everywhere—outside churches, on shop premises, and especially at family grave sites and in the home, where everyone is preparing for the annual reunion with late friends and relatives. At this time every marketplace in Oaxaca blazes with piles—absolute mountains—of fuschia-red cockscombs and intense orange marigolds. Tall sugarcanes with long fronds and huge banana leaves tower like jungles nearby. The flowers will be used to adorn the altars and the giant fronds to mark arched entries for the souls of loved ones to pass through.\nPeople buy their late cousin's favorite kind of cigarettes or their departed father's usual beer to place on the home altar. The other offerings usually include fresh fruit, candies in all kinds of macabre memento mori shapes, decorated breads made from a sweet egg-enriched dough like that for Pan Resobado, and this traditional spiced preserved pumpkin. Every home altar holds a plate of Calabaza en Tacha—an offering that represents about four days' labor of love.\nThe pumpkin—I use a regular Halloween pumpkin or sometimes the green West Indian type—is soaked first in a solution of the same cal (slaked lime) used to treat corn for tortillas. The alkali makes it firm enough to absorb the sugar without disintegrating. Oaxacan cooks like to make the preserve very sweet; I have slightly reduced the amount of sugar. It may not be traditional, but I like to serve it with vanilla ice cream.\nI find that using fresh sugarcane as a support on which to arrange the pieces of pumpkin is a handy and flavorful trick (though not an indispensable part of the recipe). Look for it at Latin American and other tropical groceries; it can also be found as a specialty produce item in some large supermarkets.","hed":"Sweet Preserved Pumpkin","pubDate":"2012-09-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Zarela Martinez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sweet-preserved-pumpkin-51116800","photoData":{"id":"5604011c08929a1609a1e64a","filename":"51116800.jpg","caption":"Sweet Preserved Pumpkin","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Sweet Preserved Pumpkin","title":"Sweet Preserved Pumpkin","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["One 7- to 8-pound pumpkin","1/2 to 3/4 cup cal (slaked lime)","4 or 5 short chunks (3 to 4 inches) fresh sugarcane, optional","3 1/2 pounds Mexican brown loaf sugar (panela or piloncillo) or 3 1/2 pounds (about 8 cups) dark brown sugar","2 teaspoons allspiece berries, bruised","1 6-inch piece canela"],"prepSteps":["Cut the pumpkin into 6 equal wedges.

Though she and her family can well afford to eat meat, they usually save it for special occasions, so they rejoiced when I asked them to teach me their favorite barbacoa. It was beautiful, breathing the scent of fresh avocado leaves and other herbs. The meat becomes unbelievably tender without drying out or getting mushy.\nWhen I came back to my New York kitchen, I set to work to find other methods close to the tender savor of a true pit barbecue. For the type that Zoyla showed me, I feel the best results come from packing the marinated meat in a tightly covered pan just large enough to hold the ingredients and baking it for a long time in a moderate oven. A turkey roaster is good. If you don't have a big enough pan with a tight-fitting lid, wrap several layers of aluminum foil very snugly around the pan to seal in the steam.\nI make the barbacoa as Zoyla made it, with young goat (kid). Goat is available in some Greek, halal Muslim, and West Indian butcher shops and can sometimes be ordered from other butchers. Ask the butcher to cut it into quarters. Oaxacans always include and specially value the head, which has some extra-tender nuggets of meat. (This is optional for the doubting.) If goat is not available, lamb is the best substitute. At my restaurant, we use lamb shoulder. The dish can also be made with a whole fresh ham or a pot-roasting cut of beef such as round, though you may have to reduce the amount of marinade slightly and experiment with a shorter cooking time. Of course true pre-Hispanic barbacoa was made with turkey—not used as frequently nowadays, but still a notably authentic choice.\nWhen the meat is cooked in an authentic pit it yields a lot of rich juices that never develop using the oven method. At my restaurant in New York we approximate this as follows: When the adobo (chile paste) is made, set aside 1 1/4 cup of the mixture and rub the meat with the rest. Cook as described below. When the meat is done, skim the fat from the pan juices and deglaze the roasting pan with 2 cups homemade chicken broth over medium-high heat, scraping up the browned bits. Stir in one 28- to 32-ounce can tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Add the reserved adobo and simmer, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes, or until reduced to about 4 cups. Let cool slightly and purée in a blender (working in batches as necessary) until smooth. Serve with the carved meat.","hed":"Goat in Chile Marinade, Pit-Barbecue Style","pubDate":"2012-09-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Zarela Martinez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/goat-in-chile-marinade-pit-barbecue-style-51117000","photoData":{"id":"5604011cc301a9f945f0612e","filename":"51117000.jpg","caption":"Goat in Chile Marinade, Pit-Barbecue Style","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Goat in Chile Marinade, Pit-Barbecue Style","title":"Goat in Chile Marinade, Pit-Barbecue Style","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["4 ounces guajillo chiles (about 16 large chiles), tops and seeds removed","2 teaspoons cumin seeds","1 teaspoon whole cloves, or 3/4 teaspoon ground","10 allspice berries","1/3 cup dried Oaxacan oregano or 1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano, crumbled","12 to 15 large sprigs fresh thyme (leaves only), or 2 teaspoons dried","10 garlic cloves","1 large onion, coarsely chopped","1/2 cup cider vinegar","1 teaspoon salt or to taste, plus additional for seasoning goat","Freshly ground black pepper","1 16-pound goat, quartered, or 6 to 8 pounds lamb shoulder, bone in, trimmed","1/2 to 3/4 ounce dried avocado leaves, about 30 large leaves"],"prepSteps":["Wash and griddle-dry the chiles by the directions below.
