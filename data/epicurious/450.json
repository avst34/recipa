Look for a good dark chocolate, which is not the same as unsweetened chocolate. Also, there are two kinds of unsweetened cocoa on the market; be sure to use unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa, not natural cocoa. When combined with baking soda, natural cocoa can impart a bitter taste to baked goods and cause them to rise too much.","hed":"Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake","pubDate":"2009-09-24T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Cory Schreiber"},{"name":" Julie Richardson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/upside-down-pear-chocolate-cake-354975","photoData":{"id":"5609a61262fa7a9917c25a0c","filename":"354975.jpg","caption":"Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake","credit":"Sara Remington","promoTitle":"Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake","title":"Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.39,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, for pan","1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar","1/4 cup water","3 firm but ripe pears, peeled, cored, and each cut into 12 slices (1 pound prepped)","1/4 cup (2 ounces) unsalted butter","4 ounces dark chocolate, chopped","1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour","1/3 cup (1 ounce) unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder","3/4 teaspoon baking soda","1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt","3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar","2 eggs","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","1/2 cup whole milk","Chantilly cream or Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, for serving (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Butter a 9-inch round baking pan.","To make the fruit topping, put the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan (one with a tight-fitting lid) and stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then cover and cook for 2 minutes. (Covering in this way allows the steam to wash down the sides of pan, which will prevent any sugar crystals from forming.) Uncover the saucepan and continue to boil the sugar, gently and slowly swirling the pan as needed to cook the caramel evenly, until it becomes a dark amber color. Occasionally wash down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Carefully pour the caramel into the prepared pan and allow it to harden. The pan will be very hot from the sugar, so take care in moving it if you need to. Fan the pear slices on top of the caramel in a circle around the perimeter, filling in the center with the remaining slices.","Preheat the oven to 350°F.","To make the cake, place the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat and melt, stirring occasionally. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Transfer the melted chocolate to a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and add the sugar. Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture in three additions alternating with the milk in two additions, beginning and ending with the flour and scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.","Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the middle of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the cake bounces back slightly when touched.

It is a simple dessert that combines tart fruit with whipped cream. The British traditionally made this dessert with gooseberries, but in spring rhubarb is the perfect choice, with its bright, tart flavor. A very simple dessert to prepare (we wince to say any fool can make it), this recipe calls for cooking a compote and then folding in whipped cream. It is elegant served with a shortbread cookie, which adds a delicious crispy element. To really doll it up, add a Candied Rhubarb Strip.","hed":"Rhubarb Fool","pubDate":"2009-09-24T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Cory Schreiber"},{"name":" Julie Richardson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rhubarb-fool-354959","photoData":{"id":"5609a60ee0acd286555db998","filename":"354959.jpg","caption":"Rhubarb Fool","credit":"Sara Remington","promoTitle":"Rhubarb Fool","title":"Rhubarb Fool","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Fruit","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.63,"ingredients":["1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed and sliced 1/2 inch thick (about 4 cups or 1 pound prepped)","1/2 cup honey","Zest and juice of 1 orange","2 tablespoons finely chopped candied ginger","1/2 vanilla bean, split","Pinch of fine sea salt","3/4 cup heavy cream","1 tablespoon granulated sugar","1 stalk rhubarb","1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar","1/2 cup water"],"prepSteps":["To make the fool, put the rhubarb, honey, orange zest and juice, candied ginger, vanilla bean, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat.
