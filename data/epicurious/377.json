In addition to the 125-pound porker we were planning to serve, we decided we should have some chicken just in case not everyone at the party wanted to partake of the sacred swine. We got about 100 birds, halved them, and soaked them in a simple marinade of just lemon, sage, and cracked black pepper. It turned out to be one of the first times—maybe the only time—there was a pig roast where chicken was the hit of the day. What really made it special was the marinade. It lent a nice acidity to the meat, which became really tender, and the sage and lemon flavors just exploded. For the most classic presentation, roast a whole bird and carve it tableside. If you want an especially crispy, golden-skinned chicken, have your butcher halve it, and roast the halves skin side up so they can self-baste as they roast.","hed":"Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage","pubDate":"2010-12-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Bruce Bromberg "},{"name":" Eric Bromberg "},{"name":" Melissa Clark"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/herb-roasted-chicken-with-lemon-and-sage-363432","photoData":{"id":"56098f4062fa7a9917c1d982","filename":"363432_hires.jpg","caption":"Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage","title":"Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 (3- to 3 1/2-pound) whole chicken, patted dry with paper towels","1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil","1 lemon, thinly sliced","1 bunch of fresh sage leaves (about 1/2 cup)","2 teaspoons kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","","3 medium carrots, peeled and halved crosswise, optional","3 celery stalks, cut crosswise into thirds, optional","1 large onion, peeled and cut into large chunks, optional"],"prepSteps":["Put the chicken in a large bowl.

Some say its origins are in Europe, where wiener schnitzel was invented, and there are some similarities. The connection ends, though, with the country-style sausage gravy with which we smother our pan-fried cutlets. Europeans serve their version with a humble (and lean) wedge of lemon. I retained the gravy but lightened it up dramatically—and instead of pan-frying the cutlets in bacon fat as they do in some parts of the South, I chose to bread and bake them.","hed":"Chicken-Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy","pubDate":"2010-12-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rocco DiSpirito"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chicken-fried-steak-with-sausage-gravy-363443","photoData":{"id":"56098f4362fa7a9917c1d98e","filename":"363443.jpg","caption":"Chicken-Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Chicken-Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy","title":"Chicken-Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 cup whole-wheat flour","2 cups whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs, such as lan's All-Natural","3 large egg whites","Four 3-ounce portions lean filet mignon, pounded about 1/3 inch thick","Nonstick cooking spray","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","","One 6-ounce link hot Italian turkey sausage, casing removed","1 cup low-fat,low-sodium chicken broth","1 tablespoon cornstarch","1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 450˚F.

It's made in the style of many French fruit tarts: thin-crusted and only lightly sweetened to let the fruit truly shine. Americans have eagerly adopted French-inspired freeform tarts, even giving them a French name, galette, a word that the French generally use to describe a round, squat pastry, cookie, or buckwheat crêpe. The most famous galette is Galette des Rois, two disks of puff pastry filled with frangipane and eaten on Epiphany. I considered calling this dessert a tart, but decided against it because that term can put off people who are worried about dealing with fussy doughs and trying to achieve picture-perfect results. This pastry is intended to be rustic, and for that reason, it's often my go-to galette. Or tart. Speaking of tart, if your apples are particularly tart, you could sprinkle a bit more sugar on top of them before baking, but if you serve a sweet accompaniment alongside, as I usually do, additional sugar probably won't be necessary.","hed":"Apple-Frangipane Galette","pubDate":"2010-12-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David Lebovitz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/apple-frangipane-galette-363437","photoData":{"id":"56098f4162fa7a9917c1d98a","filename":"363437_hires.jpg","caption":"Apple-Frangipane Galette","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Apple-Frangipane Galette","title":"Apple-Frangipane Galette","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["6 medium apples (3 pounds/1.5 kg)","Galette dough (page 231)","Frangipane (page 234)","2 tablespoons (1 ounce/30 g) unsalted or salted butter, melted","4 tablespoons (60 g) granulated or coarse-crystal sugar"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

That day I was really in the mood for some crab salad, but I wanted to do something untraditional. One of my purveyors had sent me some Tuscan cantaloupe to try, so I first made a melon emulsion. Then I tossed the crabmeat with my Colvin Vinaigrette (which is basically good on anything). I thought that avocado would be great with the melon, so I started with a little melon on the plate, then I layered sliced ripe avocado and the crab mixture with a huge quenelle of caviar I had on hand to top it all off. Honestly, it was like heaven. I had so much crab that I made two mini ones for my two friends downstairs, and they were like, \"What the hell is this flavor combination? This is amazing!\" Give it a try—it's elegant and just incredibly good.","hed":"Crab with Cantaloupe and Caviar – Sea Salad","pubDate":"2010-12-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/crab-with-cantaloupe-and-caviar-sea-salad-363470","photoData":{"id":"56098f466a59cdb91b5f795a","filename":"363470_hires.jpg","caption":"Crab with Cantaloupe and Caviar – Sea Salad","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Crab with Cantaloupe and Caviar – Sea Salad","title":"Crab with Cantaloupe and Caviar – Sea Salad","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons champagne vinegar","1 teaspoon minced shallot","1 teaspoon Dijon mustard","1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil","1/4 cup canola oil","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","","2 pounds fresh crabmeat, cooked, shelled, and picked","2 tablespoons mayonnaise","1 bunch chives, chopped","Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","","1 Tuscan cantaloupe, peeled, seeded, and cut into chunks","2 avocados, peeled, seeded, and sliced","1 ounce caviar (Sturgeon royal)"],"prepSteps":["To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the vinegar, shallot, and mustard in a bowl.
