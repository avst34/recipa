Hotchkiss also recommends using fabric that has printing on both sides; if it's only printed on one side, the blank side may show through the glass. We've allotted enough fabric that you can order an extra vase in each size for practicing.\nThese instructions are for two sizes of vase (6-by-6-inch and 1 3/4-by-1 3/4-by-8-inch).
