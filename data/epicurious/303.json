Made by transforming egg yolks, garlic, and olive oil into a creamy dip, it's Provence's answer to mayonnaise. The secret is creating a tight emulsion of the yolk and oil. The technique, thankfully, is less scientific: \"Add a thin drizzle of oil and whisk like crazy,\" says Suzanne Goin, chef at L.A.'s Lucques, Tavern, and A.O.C. Her version lets the egg shine by using half flavor-neutral grapeseed oil so the olive oil doesn't dominate. The result is a harmonious sauce with a supple texture (thanks to hand-whisking instead of using a blender) that begs to be spooned onto meat, bread, and fish. Goin serves it with salmon and poached spring vegetables, but no matter what you pair it with, this sauce is the star.","hed":"The Creamiest Aioli","pubDate":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Suzanne Goin"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/the-creamiest-aioli-395075","photoData":{"id":"54b18b1fc6a78d1a4a60d45f","filename":"395075_aioli_1x1.jpg","caption":"The Creamiest Aioli","credit":"Penden + Munk","promoTitle":"The Creamiest Aioli","title":"The Creamiest Aioli","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Condiment/Spread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 large egg yolk","1 small garlic clove, finely grated","1/4 teaspoon kosher salt plus more","1/4 cup grapeseed oil","1/4 cup good-quality extra-virgin olive oil","Pinch of cayenne pepper","Fresh lemon juice","Freshly ground black pepper"],"prepSteps":["Drape a kitchen towel over a small saucepan; set a small metal bowl over (this will hold bowl in place).

In Boston, where Lynch has five restaurants, she set out to master the dish. Her yolk-heavy recipe is beyond creamy—without cream!—with a heady mix of peppercorns (you can substitute black pepper for all and it's still great). It's unlike any clumpy carbonaras you've had. The tricks? She omits most of the egg whites; their water thins the sauce. Too much cheese overthickens it, so she gradually adds Pecorino while tossing the pasta until she hits the right consistency (the sauce should be loose enough to drag the pasta through).
