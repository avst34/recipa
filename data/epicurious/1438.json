Simmer cataplana, covered, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes and discard any unopened clams or mussels. Transfer seafood with a slotted spoon to a large bowl and boil cooking liquid, uncovered, until reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Return seafood to cooking liquid and stir in crayfish and sorrel. Heat cataplana over moderate heat until just heated through."],"reviewsCount":4,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a47a4919925f464b39b46d","dek":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.\nMakes use of the microwave oven.","hed":"Steamed Fish Fillets with Scallion-Ginger Oil","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/steamed-fish-fillets-with-scallion-ginger-oil-12170","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.92,"ingredients":["1 pound white fish fillets","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","a 1 1/2-inch-long piece of fresh gingerroot, peeled and cut into julienne strips","1 large scallion, cut into julienne strips","1 teaspoon Oriental sesame oil","soy sauce to taste as an accompaniment","white-wine vinegar or to taste as an accompaniment"],"prepSteps":["Arrange the fillets in one layer in a microwave-safe baking dish, season them with salt and pepper, and cover the dish tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap.

And the self-rising cake flour, which helps the dessert to rise triumphantly high, virtually guarantees a perfect-every time creation. A flavorful sherbet, such as banana or raspberry, makes an ideal accompaniment to this cake.","hed":"Cocoa Angel Food Cake with Orange Glaze","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/cocoa-angel-food-cake-with-orange-glaze-13713","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.6,"ingredients":["1 cup self-rising flour","1/3 cup sifted unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder such as Droste (sift before measuring)","1 1/4 cups sugar","1 1/2 cups egg whites (from 10 to 11 large eggs)","1/4 teaspoon salt","2 teaspoons vanilla","Orange Glaze"],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 325°F. and have ready an ungreased 10-inch tube pan (about 4 inched deep) with a removable bottom.","In a small bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, and 1/2 cup sugar.
