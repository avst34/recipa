Set it aside until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.","Combine the flour, salt, and powdered milk in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the egg and vegetable oil, and give the mixture a good stir. Add the yeast mixture and mix on medium speed until the ingredients are incorporated. Then raise the speed to high and continue to mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 3 minutes.","Coat a glass or ceramic bowl with olive oil, put the dough in the bowl, and roll it around to coat it with the oil. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.","Rinse the halloumi under cold running water; or, if you are using akawi packed in brine, submerge it in water, changing the bath three times to rid it of overly salty brine.

Liberally coat your hands with olive oil.","Punch the dough down. Pull off a piece about the size of a baseball and squeeze it between your thumb and index finger until a ball about the size of a walnut comes through. Separate the ball from the dough in your palm by pinching your index finger over your thumb. Flatten the ball in the palm of your hand, stretching it to fit your palm. Place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center and gather the edges around it, pinching to seal it, forming a purse shape. Dip the smooth side into the olive oil, then into the seed mixture, and place it, sealed side down, in the cake pan. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, arranging the rolls tightly in concentric circles, beginning with the outer ring and working your way to the center.","Drizzle a little olive oil over the rolls and bake until they are pale gold, about 25 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the rolls cool for a bit.","Run a knife around the rim of the pan to loosen the rolls. Invert a plate over the pan, flip the plate and pan together, and remove the pan. Invert a second plate over the rolls and flip again, so the rolls are seed side up. Place the plate on the table and let your guests pull one roll at a time from the loaf."],"reviewsCount":10,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a432b36529d92b2c0159f1","dek":"","hed":"Savory Streusel","pubDate":"2005-10-21T20:17:44.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/savory-streusel-233039","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1,"ingredients":["1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats","1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic","1/8 teaspoon salt","1/8 teaspoon black pepper","1/3 cup finely grated parmesan"],"prepSteps":["Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.","Toast oats in a baking pan, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 12 minutes.","Heat oil in a 9-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, stirring, until golden, 30 to 40 seconds.
