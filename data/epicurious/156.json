Smear remaining butter mixture onto the outside of the bird. Use your hands to massage the bird to even out the butter mixture under the skin.","Place garlic in the cavity and tie the legs together using kitchen twine. In a large roasting pan, scatter the celery and onions. Place a roasting rack on top of the vegetables, and set the turkey on the rack. Pour 1 1/2 cups broth into the pan.

Reduce oven temperature to 325°F and continue to roast, basting hourly, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165°F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Add the turkey neck, giblets, and heart (if using) and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.

Shred some of the neck meat and set aside.","When turkey is done, carefully remove it from the roasting pan, still on the rack, to a sheet pan. Cover loosely with foil and let rest in a warm place. Pour off or blot the excess fat and discard. Set the roasting pan over 2 burners on the stove. Pour in the cognac (from a cup, not the bottle) into the roasting pan, and turn the burners on to medium heat. Carefully ignite the cognac using a long lighter or match. When the flames die down, use a wooden spoon to scrape all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the contents of the roasting pan into the saucepan with the turkey stock. Simmer to reduce slightly. Add the turkey neck meat.","Knead the butter and flour together using a spoon or your fingers. Bring the stock mixture to a boil, then add the butter mixture by tablespoonfuls to the stock until the desired thickness is reached.
