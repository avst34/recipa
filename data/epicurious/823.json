The secret is to cook the fruit down to a jamlike consistency with sugar, which lowers the freezing point. We were working on our fall issues at the time, so we developed a seasonally appropriate cranberry ice cream ; we also couldn't resist taking advantage of the local peaches sitting on our countertop. Frozen peaches are a perfectly good stand-in for fresh in this case, and a scoop of peach ice cream on a slice of toasted pound cake can be a beautiful thing in the dead of winter.\nFor the silkiest peach ice cream ever, work with the all-cream base for the cranberry ice cream .","hed":"Peach Ice Cream","pubDate":"2005-10-21T19:43:35.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/peach-ice-cream-233019","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["2 pounds of fresh or frozen sliced peaches (do not peel if fresh)","1/2 cup sugar","1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"],"prepSteps":["Stir peaches together with sugar and lemon juice in a bowl.
