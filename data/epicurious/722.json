It was reprinted, along with the introductory text included here, in The 150 Best American Recipes by Fran McCullough and Molly Stevens.\n__\nProbably the most frustrating part of preparing Thanksgiving dinner is the last-minute potato mashing and gravy making. If you have this recipe in your arsenal, you can knock off the mashed potatoes 2 days ahead and have them sitting pretty in the refrigerator, ready for a last-minute heating. But that's not the only time you need these potatoes; they're also great for a buffet or for any crowd.\nThese luxurious mashed potatoes have a couple of other virtues, too. They're light and fluffy because they're whipped with an electric mixer, and they're incredibly luscious because they have sour cream and butter, plus cream cheese to give them a little edge.\n__","hed":"Party Potatoes","pubDate":"2006-10-12T14:10:34.000Z","author":[{"name":"Fran McCullough "},{"name":" Molly Stevens"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/party-potatoes-236303","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.77,"ingredients":["3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks","Coarse salt","8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, cut into 8 pieces","1 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature","1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature","2/3 cup milk, warmed, or as needed","Freshly ground black pepper","Paprika for garnish"],"prepSteps":["Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and add cold water to cover by at least 1 inch.

Even better: it's probably the most delicious one in existence—salty, cheesy, and irresistible.

It's also a great tasting and beautiful addition to a salad, especially if you're brave enough to try this: the moment the crisps come out of the oven, while they're still hot and flexible, try rolling them around the handle of a wooden spoon to form a cylinder.
