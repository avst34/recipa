Add half a cup of pasta water to the dish and gently shake to loosen all the sticky goodness from the base. Drain the spaghetti and toss straight into the dish with a squeeze of lemon juice, season to perfection, then break that beautiful ricotta over the top. Sprinkle over the arugula, toss together well, then serve. My missus likes this with a little drizzle of balsamic too."],"reviewsCount":2,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"562f9cf283f23b081c8f5fa3","dek":"I learned the joys of putting potatoes in bread during my time in the Napa Valley, so the flavors here are resonant of that magical place, but don't be afraid to change up the herbs or play with nuts and olives. You can't mess it up. Well, you can—I certainly have more than once—but you know what I mean. You can do this by hand, but it's messy, so I wrote this recipe with directions for using a stand mixer. —Duff","hed":"Rosemary Garlic Potato Bread","pubDate":"2015-11-01T15:49:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Duff Goldman"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rosemary-garlic-potato-bread","photoData":{"id":"562e85550f8ed31b2ff0d84a","filename":"Rosemary-Garlic-Potato-Bread_2000.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Caren Alpert","promoTitle":"","title":"Rosemary-Garlic-Potato-Bread","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["2 large russet potatoes, well baked and still warm","1 garlic head, roasted and still warm","2 (1/4-ounce) envelopes active dry yeast","2 tablespoons sugar","3 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for brushing","2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling","4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed","4 cups bread flour","1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary"],"prepSteps":["1.
