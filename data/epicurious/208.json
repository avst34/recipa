to Catalonia, Spain, Garrotxa is a throaty, goaty cheese that imparts an almost cheddar-like tanginess. A gray mold blankets this pasteurized flavor titan, which gets its smooth earthiness from the lush coastal grasses that feed the goats raised to make it. Cutting away the rind on this firm cheese is easy, and a sharp knife run down the sides will shave off the moldy exterior without sacrificing much of the Garrotxa beneath.\nHere, Garrotxa coalesces with two other signature Spanish ingredients, sun-dried tomatoes and Serrano ham, to create an ethereal cheese gratin polished with just a touch of butter, milk, and crème fraîche. This recipe isn't your typical melty, creamy macaroni and cheese; rather, it's a drier dish that allows the ingredients to mingle coyly while remaining somewhat independent.","hed":"Penne with Garrotxa, Serrano Ham, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes","pubDate":"2013-10-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Stephanie Stiavetti "},{"name":"Garrett McCord"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/penne-with-garrotxa-serrano-ham-and-sun-dried-tomatoes-51201410","photoData":{"id":"560347367bdffb1205b62eba","filename":"51201410_hires.jpg","caption":"Penne with Garrotxa, Serrano Ham, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes","credit":"Matt Armendariz","promoTitle":"Penne with Garrotxa, Serrano Ham, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes","title":"Penne with Garrotxa, Serrano Ham, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Cheese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["8 ounces penne","1 pound Garrotxa, shredded","1/4 cup milk","1/2 cup crème fraîche","1 tablespoon butter","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper","1/3 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes","6 ounces serrano ham slices, torn coarsely by hand into chunks"],"prepSteps":["1.

To make the sweet potato filling, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Boil the sweet potato chunks just until tender, about 10 minutes.","2. Drain the potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.","3. Transfer the hot potatoes and reserved cooking water, the brown sugar, vegan butter, vanilla, and salt to a medium bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until totally smooth, then set aside to fully cool.","4. Meanwhile, make the sweet kraut. Heat the oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add the cabbage and allow it to start to sear for about 3 minutes, then add the brown sugar and spices. Let the sugar start to melt with the cabbage juice for another 3 minutes, then add the Riesling. Allow the cabbage to cook down and steam itself for another 8 to 10 minutes. The cabbage will now be dark pink instead of purple. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool fully.","5. While the potatoes and kraut are cooling, make the turnover crust. Pulse together the flour, vegan butter, and vegan shortening until it looks chunky and sandy. Add the sugar, olive oil, cinnamon, salt, and allspice and pulse again. While pulsing, slowly drizzle in 2 to 3 tablespoons cold water, little by little-just until a loose dough ball is formed and spins around the bowl of the food processor. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 days.","6. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.","7. On a work surface dusted with flour, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick. Use a 4-inch-wide circle cutter to stamp out the turnover shells. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the sweet potato filling in the center of each dough circle. Bring the edges of the circle together, forming a half circle, and pinch them together tightly. Use a fork to crimp the edges of the seal. Arrange the turnovers on the prepared sheet pan.","8. Bake the turnovers until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Arrange on serving dishes with the sweet kraut and serve."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"54a422f56529d92b2c0096e8","dek":"When we visited Kyoto, a few hours' ride from Tokyo on the famous Bullet train, we found a little restaurant in the heart of town that won us over with the names of dishes listed on the menu: Firecracker Tofu, Pickled Mixed Radish Salad, and the mysterious sounding Okonomiyaki. The chefs were clearly having fun at this place, and we were blown away by the depth of flavor they achieved with such simple preparations. We threw back some sake and tore through plate after plate of food. This salad is inspired by that meal, featuring quirky sea beans (a seaweed-like swamp/beach vegetable) and the haunting flavor of shiso (Japanese mint). You can find fresh sea beans at a gourmet market. If they're not available, substitute pencil-thin asparagus. Look for shiso in Asian markets, but substitute fresh cilantro if you can't find it.","hed":"Sea Bean Salad with Daikon and Cucumber","pubDate":"2013-10-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rich Landau "},{"name":" Kate Jacoby"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sea-bean-salad-with-daikon-and-cucumber-51199610","photoData":{"id":"54ad4bf76529d92b2c043930","filename":"51199610_sea-bean-salad-daikon_1x1.jpg","caption":"Sea Bean Salad with Daikon and Cucumber","credit":"Michael Spain-Smith","promoTitle":"Sea Bean Salad with Daikon and Cucumber","title":"Sea Bean Salad with Daikon and Cucumber","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["2 large cucumbers, peeled (about 1 1/2 pounds)","1 large daikon radish, peeled","4 scallions","1/2 pound sea beans, ends trimmed","3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar","2 tablespoons canola oil","2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil","2 tablespoons tamari","2 teaspoons black sesame seeds","2 teaspoons white sesame seeds","1 teaspoon sugar","2 fresh shiso leaves, finely chopped"],"prepSteps":["1.
