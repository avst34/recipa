Wearing heatproof gloves, arrange bricks on top of turkey, with 3 across breast and 1 across drumsticks, or place cinder block in the center. Cover grill and cook, checking every 5 minutes, until skin side is deep golden brown and crispy, 10–15 minutes total.","Wearing heatproof gloves, carefully remove bricks or cinder block and flip bird over, skin side up. Cover grill and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F (take temperature in a few places including thickest part of thigh and breast), 65–80 minutes more, replenishing coals if needed. Transfer turkey to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest at least 30 minutes before carving.","Turkey can be seasoned with dry brine ideally 2 days but up to 3 days ahead. Keep chilled."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"59cd721f74c8004cea2a45fe","dek":"This creamy, tangy sauce with a garlicky, black pepper punch is ubiquitous on platters of grilled meats sold by halal street carts in major cities across the U.S. We can't stop drizzling it on everything from pita sandwiches to roasted vegetables to crisp salads.","hed":"Halal Cart-Style White Sauce","pubDate":"2017-09-28T22:20:47.194Z","author":[{"name":"Rhoda Boone"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/halal-cart-style-white-sauce","photoData":{"id":"59bc2a2ffe32c93fe50c8c91","filename":"SAUCE-Streetcart-Kebab-White-Sauce-12092017.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Surbatovich, Food Styling by Olivia Mack Anderson","promoTitle":"","title":"SAUCE: Streetcart Kebab White Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Sauce","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["3/4 cup mayonnaise","1/2 cup plain Greek-style yogurt","2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar","1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","1 teaspoon sugar","1/2 teaspoon dried dill","1/2 teaspoon garlic powder","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"],"prepSteps":["Stir mayonnaise, yogurt, vinegar, pepper, sugar, dill, garlic powder, salt, and 1 Tbsp. water in a medium bowl.","Sauce can be made 5 days ahead.
