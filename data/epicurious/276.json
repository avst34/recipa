Making a generous amount of well-flavored turkey jus or gravy involves a paradox; if the turkey is properly cooked or if it is stuffed, it will release little in the way of juices. When overcooked, as most turkeys are, it will provide plenty of juices for your gravy. If the turkey has released an abundance of juices—a couple of cups (500 milliliters) or more—serving the jus is a simple matter of skimming off the fat and serving the juices as they are, as a \"jus.\" To convert them to gravy, make a roux and add the juices to that. To make giblet gravy, roast the giblets in the pan along with the turkey, chop them fine, and add them to the gravy.\nIf you've cooked your turkey just right, you won't see much in the bottom of the pan and what there is won't have a whole lot of flavor. To get the most flavor out of a small amount of juices, boil down the juices until they caramelize on the bottom of the pan, pour out the fat (or leave a few tablespoons in the pan if you're making a roux), and deglaze the pan with water or broth. Use only as much broth as you need to serve the guests at hand—about 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) per person—because the more broth you add, the less flavorful the juice will be. If you're a fanatic, you can bring up the flavor of the jus by adding a little broth at a time and caramelizing after each addition. To stretch a small amount of jus without diluting its flavor, consider swirling in 1/2 ounce (15 grams) of butter per serving.","hed":"Roast Turkey with Jus, Gravy, or Giblet Gravy","pubDate":"2012-09-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"James Peterson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roast-turkey-with-jus-gravy-or-giblet-gravy-51120030","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Poultry","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 roast turkey, giblets roasted in the pan with the turkey","3 tablespoons flour (for gravy) (45 milliliters)","2 cups turkey or chicken broth or water (as needed if there are insufficient juices) (500 milliliters)","3 ounces cold butter, sliced (optional) (90 grams)","salt and pepper to taste to taste",""],"prepSteps":["1.

Unfortunately, that is not the case in America.

Other possible additions include peppers, radishes, lettuce, chile, mint, parsley, cilantro, allspice, cinnamon, and sumac. Each cook, each fmily, each community has their own variation. A small bone of contention is the size of the dice. Some advocate the tiniest of pieces, only 1/8 inch / 3 mm wide, others like them coarser, up to 3/4 inch / 2 cm wide. The one thing that there is no arguing over is that the key lies in the quality of the vegetables. They must be fresh, ripe, and flavorsome, with many hours in the sun behind them.\nThis fabulous salad is probably Sami's mother's creation; Sami can't recall anyone else in the neighborhood making it. She called it fattoush, which is only true to the extent that it includes chopped vegetables and bread. She added a kind of homemade buttermilk and didn't fry her bread, which makes it terribly comforting.\nTry to get small cucumbers for this as for any other fresh salad. They are worlds apart from the large ones we normally get in most supermarkets. You can skip the fermentation stage and use only buttermilk instead of the combination of milk and yogurt.","hed":"Na'ama's Fattoush","pubDate":"2012-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Yotam Ottolenghi"},{"name":" Sami Tamimi"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/naamas-fattoush-51115620","photoData":{"id":"54b07fc61cc76a014cfa9d54","filename":"51115620_fattoush_1x1.jpg","caption":"Na'ama's Fattoush","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin","promoTitle":"Na'ama's Fattoush","title":"Na'ama's Fattoush","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Middle Eastern","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.8,"ingredients":["scant 1 cup / 200 g Greek yogurt and 3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp / 200 ml whole milk, or 1 2/3 cups / 400 ml buttermilk (replacing both yogurt and milk)","","2 large stale Turkish flatbread or naan (9 oz /250 g in total)","3 large tomatoes (13 oz / 380 g in total), cut into 2/3-inch / 1.5cm dice","3 1/2 oz / 100 g radishes, thinly sliced","3 Lebanese or mini cucumbers (9 oz / 250 g in total), peeled and chopped into 2/3-inch / 1.5cm dice","2 green onions, thinly sliced","1/2 oz / 15 g fresh mint","scant 1 oz / 25 g flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped","1 tbsp dried mint","2 cloves garlic, crushed","3 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice","1/4 cup / 60 ml olive oil, plus extra to drizzle","2 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar","3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper","1 1/2 tsp salt","1 tbsp sumac or more to taste, to garnish"],"prepSteps":["If using yogurt and milk, start at least 3 hours and up to a day in advance by placing both in a bowl.

Summer months are always tinted with the smell of wild herbs and ripe figs. The mother of Sami's childhood neighbor and friend, Jabbar, used her roof to dry the glut of figs (and tomatoes) in the hot summer sun, spending hours cleaning and sorting them meticulously. Poor Um Jabbar Sami and her son never wasted time and used to sneak up to her roof regularly, stealing her figs at their peak and causing havoc. This wasn't enough for Jabbar, though. The boy had such a sweet tooth that he always carried around with him an old match box full of sugar cubes, just in case. Unfortunately, this habit had clear ramifications, evident in his \"charming\" smile.\nThis unusual combination of fresh fruit and roasted vegetables is one of the most popular at Ottolenghi. It wholly depends, though, on the figs being sweet, moist, and perfectly ripe. Go for plump fruit with an irregular shape and a slighty split bottom. Pressing against the skin should result in some resistance but not much. Try to smell the sweetness. The balsamic reduction is very effective here, both for the look and for rounding up the flavors. To save you from making it, you can look for products such as balsamic cream or glaze.","hed":"Roasted Sweet Potatoes & Fresh Figs","pubDate":"2012-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Yotam Ottolenghi"},{"name":" Sami Tamimi"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roasted-sweet-potatoes-fresh-figs-51115420","photoData":{"id":"54b07fa61cc76a014cfa9c59","filename":"51115420_roasted-sweet-potatoes-figs_1x1.jpg","caption":"Roasted Sweet Potatoes & Fresh Figs ","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin","promoTitle":"Roasted Sweet Potatoes & Fresh Figs ","title":"Roasted Sweet Potatoes & Fresh Figs ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.82,"ingredients":["4 small sweet potatoes (2 1/4 lb / 1 kg in total)","5 tbsp olive oil","scant 3 tbsp / 40 ml balsamic vinegar (you can use a commercial rather than a premium aged grade)","1 1/2 tbsp / 20 g superfine sugar","12 green onions, halved lengthwise and cut into 1 1/2-in / 4cm segments","1 red chile, thinly sliced","6 ripe figs (8 1/2 oz / 240 g in total), quartered","5 oz / 150 g soft goat's milk cheese (optional)","Maldon sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",""],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 475°F / 240°C.","Wash the sweet potatoes, halve them lengthwise, and then cut each half again similarly into 3 long wedges.

It was the site of the Battle of Hue, one of the longest and deadliest battles of the Tet Offensive, which began in January 1968, and of the Vietnam War. Although I was just a kid when the fighting took place, the stories that I heard about it during my childhood were frightening.\nHue was the imperial capital of Vietnam for nearly a century and a half, until 1945, and many of the most sophisticated and interesting dishes in the Vietnamese repertoire originated in the region, including this classic spicy beef soup. The light stock, which is made with beef and pork bones, is scented with lots of lemongrass and shrimp paste. Any rice noodle can be used here, but the usual choice is the round rice noodle that resembles spaghetti.
