For a more authentic take on the dish, substitute rice noodles for the capellini or thin spaghetti. (To cook: Soak the rice noodles in a large bowl of cold water for 15 minutes, then drain the noodles, and boil in salted water until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the noodles, rinse under cold water, and drain again.) You can also replace the dried hot red pepper flakes with an equal amount of sambal oelek, and use 1 1/2 tablespoons (or more to taste) fish sauce in place of the soy sauce and anchovy paste. Also: Feel free to use flank or skirt steak in place of the shell steak, adjusting the cooking time as necessary.","hed":"Vietnamese-Style Grilled Steak with Noodles","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/vietnamese-style-grilled-steak-with-noodles-12166","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.51,"ingredients":["6 ounces capellini, or other thin spaghetti","3 tablespoons white-wine vinegar","1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce","2 garlic cloves, minced","4 teaspoons sugar","1/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes","1/4 teaspoon salt","1/8 teaspoon anchovy paste","1/4 cup packed fresh mint leaves, shredded, or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled, plus 2 mint sprigs for garnish","","two 3/4-inch-thick boneless shell steaks (about 1 pound)","3/4 cup fresh bean sprouts, rinsed and drained","1/2 red bell pepper, cut into julienne strips"],"prepSteps":["In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the capellini until it is just tender and drain it in a colander.
