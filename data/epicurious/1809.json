Preheat the oven to 450°F.","2. Remove the giblets from the capon. Rinse out the cavity with cold water and pat it dry. Season it with salt and pepper. Carefully separate the skin from the meat of the breast meat of the capon. Divide the butter in two equal parts, and carefully spread half of it on each side of the breast meat with your fingers, being careful not to break the skin. Carefully lay a bay leaf atop the butter on each side of the breast meat.","3. Coarsely chop the giblets. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the pork, the breadcrumbs, the giblets, the chestnuts, the thyme, and the spices, working the mixture together with your fingers so it is homogeneous.

Roast it for 25 minutes, then turn it on the other side and roast it for 25 minutes. Finally, leaving it breast up, continue to roast it until the juices of the capon run golden and the stuffing inside the bird reaches a temperature of 160°F, a total of about 2 hours, checking it occasionally to be sure that it isn't browning too much, and adding more water if the pan is dry. Remove the capon from the oven and season it liberally with salt and pepper. Turn it on its breast at an angle, so the juices run into the breast meat, and let it rest for at least 20 minutes before carving.","5. Place the roasting pan over medium heat and add three-quarters cup water. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan and cook until reduced by about one-third. Taste for seasoning.","6.
