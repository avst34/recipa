Caramel sauce is the most complex tasting sauce I know and it goes with every flavor in the pastry kitchen: apples, nuts, berries, stone fruit, chocolate, coffee, and pineapple. It is a staple in my kitchen. I use it to dress up store-bought ice cream, serve it alongside cake, and layer it into parfaits. Frankly, no commercial caramel sauce compares to one that's homemade. There are a few good specialty ones out there, but they are expensive. Making it at home is inexpensive—sugar, water, and cream. That's it. It keeps for weeks in the fridge and can be reheated in the microwave or double boiler.\nI know a lot of cooks who are afraid to make caramel. It can be tricky business for sure. Lest I scare you off, let me reassure you that if you follow these instructions carefully, you'll soon be making it all the time.\nIf your first try is a light tan and the sauce is thin even after it's cooled, next time cook the caramel a little bit further. On the other hand, if the caramel has a bitter aftertaste, next time cook it a little less.\nA pastry chef trick to easily clean a pot you have just made caramel in is to fill it half full of water and bring it to a boil. The hot water will dissolve any hard caramel pieces that stick to the side. Another trick, on the off chance you do burn your caramel and you want to get rid of it, is to add a couple cups of water, carefully at first, just as when you add the cream, to dilute it.

You need to cool the custard quickly to keep it from overcooking.","hed":"Fudgsicle Bars with Caramel and Spanish Peanuts","pubDate":"2011-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Emily Luchetti"},{"name":" Lisa Weiss"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/fudgsicle-bars-with-caramel-and-spanish-peanuts-366049","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["9- by 9-inch baking pan","Heat-proof rubber spatula","6 large egg yolks","1/2 cup granulated sugar","Large pinch kosher salt","4 cups heavy cream","4 ounces dark chocolate (58 to 62 percent cacao), chopped or broken into 1-inch pieces","2 tablespoons instant coffee granules","1/2 cup Spanish peanuts","1 1/2 cups Caramel Sauce , or good-quality store-bought caramel sauce"],"prepSteps":["1. Line the baking pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on 2 sides. Set aside. Fill a large bowl half full of ice and cover the ice with water. Set aside.","2. In a medium bowl that will fit into the large bowl of ice water, whisk the yolks with the sugar and salt until well blended.","3. In a large saucepan, warm the cream over medium heat until it starts to bubble around the edges. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate and coffee until smooth. Slowly pour the chocolate cream into the bowl with the egg yolks.

(If you don't have a colander, just rub them in the towel.) Don't worry about getting all the skins - you just want to remove the loose pieces. Chop the peanuts into 1/4-inch or smaller pieces.","7. To serve, holding the foil, lift the Fudgsicles out of the pan. Peel back the foil. Cut the firm fudge into 3-inch squares. Place a piece on each plate. Let sit for 5 minutes to soften.

Take what is basically a thin cake batter, fold in whipped egg whites, put the batter into a baking dish (or several ramekins as I do here), and voilà! As it bakes, the batter separates and forms a sponge cake on the top with a thick, kind of custardy pudding on the bottom. Lemon pudding cakes are common in the South, but I've swapped lemon for Key lime juice.\nTo coat the insides of the ramekins with sugar, grease them with nonstick cooking spray or butter, put 1 tablespoon sugar in one, and then tilt and turn it around, tapping to coat all the inside surfaces. Tap the excess sugar into the next ramekin and repeat the process until all are dusted, adding more sugar as needed.","hed":"Key Lime Pudding Cakes","pubDate":"2011-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Emily Luchetti"},{"name":" Lisa Weiss"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/key-lime-pudding-cakes-366009","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["6 (6-ounce) ramekins or custard cups","Electric stand mixer or a handheld mixer and medium bowl","Rubber spatula","9- by 13-inch baking pan that will hold the ramekins","2 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup granulated sugar","2 large eggs","3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature","1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour","1/8 teaspoon kosher salt","1 cup whole milk","1/4 cup Key lime juice","1/4 cup sliced almonds"],"prepSteps":["1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and put the oven rack in the middle of the oven.","2. Grease the insides of the ramekins with nonstick cooking spray or butter and evenly coat with the 2 tablespoons sugar (see headnote). Separate the eggs into 2 bowls.","3. Using the stand mixer, or a handheld mixer and medium bowl, first on low speed and then gradually increasing the speed to medium, beat the butter and the 1/2 cup sugar together until smooth. Scrape down the side of the bowl with the rubber spatula. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition, stopping once or twice to scrape down the side of the bowl. Reduce the speed to medium-low, add the flour and salt, and mix until everything is evenly combined. Mix in the milk, 1/3 cup at a time. Then, by hand, stir in the Key lime juice. The batter will be thin. Set aside while you whip the egg whites.","4. With a handheld or stand mixer, whisk the egg whites in a clean dry bowl on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until the whites hold a peak on the whisk or beaters (stop the mixer and lift to check).","5. Using the rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the Key lime mixture. Using a measuring cup to scoop up the batter evenly, divide it among the ramekins so it comes to within 1/4 inch of the rims.","6. It's best to find a space near your oven to fill the baking pan with water so you don't have to walk too far. Place the ramekins in the baking pan and, using a container with a spout, slowly pour very hot tap water into the pan so that the water comes about half the way up the sides of the ramekins. Carefully transfer the baking pan to the oven. Bake the puddings until some begin to turn golden brown and have cracked slightly on the surface, about 40 minutes.","7. Remove the baking pan from the oven. Let cool until you can pick up the ramekins (15 minutes or so), then remove them from the water.","8. Spread the almonds in one layer in a small baking pan and put it in the still-warm oven. Set a timer for 10 minutes and check the nuts to see if they're a light golden brown. If not, toast 2 minutes longer. Set aside to cool.","9. Serve the cakes warm or at room temperature, the almonds scattered on top just before serving."],"reviewsCount":2,"willMakeAgainPct":50},{"id":"54a4245f6529d92b2c00a693","dek":"","hed":"Raspberry Corn Muffins","pubDate":"2011-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Emily Luchetti"},{"name":" Lisa Weiss"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/raspberry-corn-muffins-366010","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Egg","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.85,"ingredients":["Standard 12-cup muffin pan","1 cup cornmeal","1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour","1/2 cup granulated sugar","2 teaspoons baking powder","1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","2 large eggs","3/4 cup buttermilk or 3/4 cup whole milk mixed with 1 teaspoon lemon juice","12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted","3 tablespoons honey","1 1/2 cups raspberries"],"prepSteps":["1.
