Season inside of breast with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Transfer skin side up to a rimmed baking sheet; season with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Repeat with remaining breast. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, or chill up to 24 hours for maximum flavor and juiciness (if chilled, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting).","Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 450°F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage, stirring and breaking up into small pieces with a spoon, until browned and cooked through, 5–7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a large bowl, leaving drippings behind.","Meanwhile, place croutons on a rimmed baking sheet. Crush slightly with the bottom of a small pot or pan until some pieces are smaller.","Return skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 Tbsp. butter. Add onion, squash, chopped fennel, garlic, thyme, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6–8 minutes. Stir in kale, 2 Tbsp. butter, and 1 cup broth and cook, scraping up brown bits on bottom of pan, until kale is wilted and butter is melted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl with sausage. Fold in croutons and parsley; if mixture seems dry, add 1/4 cup broth.","Flip breasts so they are skin side down. Divide stuffing between breasts, spreading with a spatula and leaving a 1\" border. Starting at 1 short end, roll each breast into a log, completely enclosing stuffing, then transfer each to separate, large pieces of cheesecloth. Wrap cheesecloth around turkey and secure by tying a piece of twine at each end (like a sausage). Tie 4–5 pieces of twine crosswise around log, spacing about 2–2 1/2\" apart. Rub remaining 4 Tbsp. butter all over breasts and transfer skin side up to roasting pan.","Pour enough broth (about 4 cups) to come 1/4\" up sides of turkey. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and roast turkey, basting with pan juices every 20 minutes and adding more broth if pan starts to dry out, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 155°F, 60–70 minutes.","Transfer to a cutting board and let sit 15–20 minutes (internal temperature should rise to 165°F). Remove twine and slice crosswise about 1/2\" thick to serve.","Turkey can be seasoned 2 days ahead and stuffed, rolled in cheesecloth, and buttered 1 day ahead; loosely cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting."],"reviewsCount":1,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"582b73b846bb53ee63488c56","dek":"One simple master recipe, based on a classic French pain de mie, proves endlessly changeable—feel free to think of the five suggestions that accompany it here as merely a start, and let your imagination take it from there.","hed":"Dinner Rolls Six Ways","pubDate":"2016-11-23T20:30:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sam Worley"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/dinner-rolls-six-ways","photoData":{"id":"5823a45330a232866c111cb8","filename":"dinner-rolls-6-ways-09112016.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Kat Boytsova","promoTitle":"","title":"Dinner Rolls 6 Ways - Recipe","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1/2 cup whole milk","1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)","2 teaspoons kosher salt","2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more","1 tablespoon honey","4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened, cut into pieces, plus 2 tablespoons melted","Olive oil (for bowl)","Ingredients for variations (see below)"],"prepSteps":["Heat milk in a small saucepan over low until warm to the touch (an instant-read thermometer should register 120°F–130°F).
