Lift 2 opposite corners together to form a triangle and enclose filling, pressing edges firmly around mound of filling to eliminate air pockets and seal.

Curl moistened corners toward each other, overlapping one on top of the other, and carefully press corners together to seal. Make more tortelli in same manner.
