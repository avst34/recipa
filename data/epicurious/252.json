To speed preparation, feel free to skip the first step of salting and rinsing the eggplant and zucchini (this process draws off any bitter juices). Instead, just remove any particularly seedy and brown parts of the eggplant, or use smaller Japanese eggplants (which also do not need to be peeled). For pizzazz, add chickpeas and pitted, chopped oil-cured black olives. To make this dish vegan, swap in olive oil for the butter and skip the cheese (adding olives will make up for cheese's saltiness).\nWhen reheating the polenta, add liquid (such as chicken stock or milk), then adjust the seasoning if necessary with more salt, pepper, and butter.","hed":"Slow-Cooked Ratatouille Over Goat Cheese Polenta","pubDate":"2013-03-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Dina Cheney"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/slow-cooked-ratatouille-over-goat-cheese-polenta-51152210","photoData":{"id":"5600482f8bed7b35040ac48d","filename":"51152210_slow-cooked-ratatouille.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Andrew Purcell","promoTitle":"","title":"51152210 slow-cooked-ratatouille.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Slow Cooker","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.04,"ingredients":["Cooking spray","2 large eggplants, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 10 1/2 cups)","3 medium zucchini or yellow summer squash, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 6 1/2 cups)","3 tablespoons coarse salt","3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided","2 small to medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced (about 3 1/2 cups)","2 red bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 cups)","3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic","1/4 cup all-purpose flour","1/4 cup tomato paste","One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves","10 grinds black pepper","1/2 cup packed freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1/4 pound)","1 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves","6 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken stock","1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt","1 1/2 cups polenta or coarse-ground cornmeal (not instant)","1/2 stick unsalted butter","4 ounces fresh goat cheese (about 1/2 cup)","10 grinds black pepper"],"prepSteps":["1.

As of 2011, their average life expectancy was 82.3 years. (The United States came in fiftieth, at 78.4 years.) Researchers often credit their diet, and this soup is my way of cramming as much of their healthy cuisine into a bowl as possible. It's called Bento Box Soup because of the traditional Japanese take-out bento box lunch, which is full of compartments, each containing a tasty treat: fish or meat, rice, pickled or cooked veggies, and other goodies. The base is a miso broth; if you're not in the know about miso, it's a salty fermented soy product that aids digestion and improves immune function. In case white miso isn't available, use any mellow (light) miso. I kicked those healing properties up a notch by infusing green tea into the broth for an extra immune boost, then added shiitakes, spinach, kombu, scallions, and tamari.","hed":"Bento Box Soup","pubDate":"2013-02-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rebecca Katz "},{"name":" Mat Edelson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/bento-box-soup-51151600","photoData":{"id":"54b4036d2413537c0d4582af","filename":"51151600_bento-box-soup_1x1.jpg","caption":"Bento Box Soup","credit":"Leo Gong","promoTitle":"Bento Box Soup","title":"Bento Box Soup","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.9,"ingredients":["4 ounces soba noodles","4 cups organic vegetable or chicken broth, homemade or store-bought","1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil or hot pepper sesame oil","1 (6-inch) strip of kombu","3 green tea bags","1 carrot, peeled and grated","1/2 cup stemmed and sliced shiitake mushrooms","4 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes","2 tablespoons tamari","1/4 cup white miso","2 scallions, white and green parts, sliced diagonally","1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice","1 1/2 cups loosely packed baby spinach"],"prepSteps":["Fill a soup pot halfway with water and bring to a boil over high heat.
