Use only a tiny amount — it's quite strong.","hed":"White-Cut Chicken","pubDate":"2006-02-01T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/white-cut-chicken-233793","photoData":{"id":"560dd6f87b55306961bfa8d3","filename":"233793.jpg","caption":"White-Cut Chicken","credit":"Mikkel Vang","promoTitle":"White-Cut Chicken","title":"White-Cut Chicken","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Chinese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.4,"ingredients":["1 (3- to 3 1/2-lb) whole chicken (with head and feet if desired), neck (if without head) and giblets reserved for another use if desired","1 bunch scallions, halved crosswise","2 oz Smithfield or other cured ham (1 piece or sliced), trimmed of any spice coating","6 (1/4-inch-thick) round slices peeled fresh ginger","14 cups water","1 teaspoon salt","1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil","1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves","1 bunch scallions (white and pale green parts only), cut into very thin 2-inch strips","3 tablespoons light soy sauce (preferably Pearl River Bridge brand)","3 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil","1 tablespoon finely grated (with a rasp) peeled fresh ginger","","","a rasp grater; a well-seasoned 14-inch flat-bottomed wok; a heavy cleaver"],"prepSteps":["Rinse chicken inside and out, then bend legs to tuck feet (if still attached) inside cavity.
