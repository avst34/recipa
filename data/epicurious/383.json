They also improve immeasurably with age.\nIn a sign of the times, the recipe ran next to a cartoon of a woman emerging from a car in front of a fancy restaurant, peering at the 30-minute parking sign and saying to her husband, \"Sometimes I think you park in these restricted areas so we won't have time to order the deluxe dinner.\"","hed":"Honey Refrigerator Cookies","pubDate":"2010-11-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/honey-refrigerator-cookies-362609","photoData":{"id":"54b33cbf21388ef838b07bdf","filename":"362609_refrigerator-cookies_1x1.jpg","caption":"Honey Refrigerator Cookies","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Honey Refrigerator Cookies","title":"Honey Refrigerator Cookies","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cookies","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.47,"ingredients":["1/2 cup honey","1/2 cup brown sugar","1/2 cup shortening","1 egg","2 1/2 cups flour","1 teaspoon baking powder","1/4 teaspoon soda (see Recipe Notes)","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/2 cup nut meats (see Recipe Notes)"],"prepSteps":["Cream together 1/2 cup each of honey, brown sugar, and shortening.
