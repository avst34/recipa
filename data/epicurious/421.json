In China, cooks traditionally toast the peppercorns to release their aroma and then grind them together with salt. Juicy roast chicken liberally rubbed with this spice blend makes a universally appealing dish. Its flavor is warm and subtle—serve the extra spice blend on the side so guests can sprinkle more on if they want to.","hed":"Sichuan Pepper-Salt Roast Chicken","pubDate":"2010-03-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":" Lillian Chou"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sichuan-pepper-salt-roast-chicken-358036","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, toasted","2 teaspoons coarse salt","1 whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pound)","1 tablespoon olive oil","an electric coffee/spice grinder; an instant-read thermometer",""],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle.","Finely grind peppercorns with salt in grinder.","Pat chicken dry, then rub with olive oil and 2 teaspoons pepper-salt (reserve remainder).
