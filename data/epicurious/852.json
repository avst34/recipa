Given her upbringing, it's no surprising that she married a waterman, Brice Phillips. The couple made their way to Ocean City, Maryland, and opened a crab shack, selling \"jimmies\" — heavy, fat, perfectly seasoned crabs — to tourists and locals alike.\nAlmost fifty years later, that roadside crab shack has evolved into one of the largest seafood operations in America, Phillips foods. Miss Shirley is still a part of the daily operation of her signature Ocean City restaurant, which serves thousands of crab cakes every season. According to Shirley, the secret to a good crab cake is good crab, lots of lumps, and simple seasoning.","hed":"Miss Shirley's Eastern Shore Crab Cakes","pubDate":"2005-05-20T18:58:09.000Z","author":[{"name":"John Shields"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/miss-shirleys-eastern-shore-crab-cakes-232203","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["2 eggs","2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce","2 teaspoons lemon juice","2 teaspoons crab seasoning, such as Phillips' seafood seasoning","2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes","2 heaping tablespoons mayonnaise","1/2 teaspoon dry mustard","2 pounds jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over","4 slices white bread, crumbled","Vegetable oil, for frying","Soda crackers for serving","Tasty Tartar Sauce"],"prepSteps":["In a medium-size bowl, thoroughly combine the eggs, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice crab seasoning, parsley, mayonnaise and mustards.","Place the crabmeat in a large bowl gently fold in the breadcrumbs and the egg mixture so as not to break up the lumps.

Since 1898, the Lassen family has been grinding its own beef daily, hand shaping patties to order, and grilling burgers on antique cast-iron broilers in front of live flames. (This answers the question once and for all — the proper way to cook a hamburger is by grilling, not by frying it on a griddle.) And as any regional American culinary landmark should be, Louis' Lunch is sufficiently quirky to allow melted processed cheese but militantly prohibit ketchup and mustard as accompaniments to its signature burgers. Here, then, is the next best thing to elbowing your way up to the counter at Louis'.","hed":"The Ultimate Hamburger","pubDate":"2005-05-17T20:30:36.000Z","author":[{"name":"Steven Raichlen"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/the-ultimate-hamburger-232191","photoData":{"id":"57c5c6d9cf9e9ad43de2d96e","filename":"the-ultimate-hamburger.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"the-ultimate-hamburger.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.5,"ingredients":["1 1/4 pounds ground chuck","1 1/4 pounds ground sirloin","Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper","N/A freshly ground black pepper","1/2 medium-size onion, cut into 8 thin wedges","16 slices sandwich bread","3 tablespoons butter, melted (optional)","1 large or 2 medium-size gorgeous, luscious, ripe red tomatoes, thinly sliced","8 Boston lettuce leaves or iceberg lettuce slices","Cheese Sauce (optional)"],"prepSteps":["1. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high.","2.

Grill the burgers until cooked to taste, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer through the side of a burger into the center. The internal temperature should be about 145°F for medium-rare or, if using commercial ground beef, cook it to at least medium, 160°F.","6. Meanwhile, place the bread slices on the hot grate and grill until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side.","7. To serve, place a lettuce leaf on top of a slice of toast.
