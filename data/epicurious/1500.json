In a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag toss the wings with the garlic paste and the oil to coat them well and let them marinate, chilled, for at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain the wings and pat them dry. Arrange the wings, skin side up, on the oiled rack of a broiler pan, sprinkle them with salt and pepper to taste, and broil them under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Turn the wings, sprinkle them with salt and pepper to taste, and broil them for 5 to 8 minutes more, or until they are golden. While the wings are broiling, in a saucepan stir together the red pepper flakes, the corn syrup, and the vinegar, bring the liquid to a boil, stirring, and transfer it to a bowl. Serve the wings with the sauce."],"reviewsCount":14,"willMakeAgainPct":100}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:51:20.868Z","count":1944,"number":1500,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1501&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1499&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
