In delicatessens, diners, and airport snack bars everywhere, we find its faithful components: lifeless leaves of iceberg lettuce, suspiciously blue-hued slices of hard-boiled egg, wedges of pallid tomato, and rubbery chunks of cheese, ham, and turkey. To top it all off (or perhaps sitting alongside): gloppy, high-calorie dressing.\nBut this still-beloved salad may have had a noble beginning. Though nobody has ever stepped forward to claim the title of the chef in \"chef's salad,\" the dish has been attributed by some food historians to Louis Diat, chef of The Ritz-Carlton in New York City in the early 1940s. He paired watercress with halved hard-boiled eggs and julienne strips of smoked tongue, ham, and chicken. (The concept of the chef’s salad dates still earlier; one seventeenth-century English recipe for a \"grand sallet\" calls for lettuce, roast meat, and a slew of vegetables and fruits.)\nNo matter how the salad has evolved, its underlying virtue remains unchanged. This is a no-cook meal that satisfies our cravings for greens and protein. And, in these dog days of summer-when cooking is sometimes the last thing we'd like to do-a main-course salad is especially appealing.\nIn our updated take on the classic recipe, we used a selection of lettuces (early chef's salads were not always made with iceberg alone), and, in a twist on the norm, small but flavorful amounts of sugar-cured ham and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Feel free to improvise with ingredients depending on what looks good at your farmers market. Summer savory or dill can flavor the dressing in place of the mixed herbs, and many kinds of ham and cheese will work well.","hed":"Chef's Salad","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chefs-salad-102212","photoData":{"id":"5612e61bf35fab51707e7ec6","filename":"102212.jpg","caption":"Chef's Salad","credit":"Gourmet's Studios","promoTitle":"Chef's Salad","title":"Chef's Salad","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.75,"ingredients":["6 carrots","8 radishes","a 1-pound piece ham","1 head romaine","1 small head radicchio","1 small head frisée (French curly endive)","a 3-ounce container sunflower sprouts","a 15- to 19-ounce can chick-peas","1 red onion","1 teaspoon salt","1 garlic clove","2/3 cup packed fresh basil leaves","1/4 cup packed fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves","3 tablespoons mixed fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and marjoram","3 tablespoons white-wine vinegar","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/2 cup olive oil","a piece Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1/3 pound)","3/4 pound cherry tomatoes"],"prepSteps":["Shred carrots and thinly slice radishes.
