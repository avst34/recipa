In fact, I make it often throughout the year.\nIt is quite different from the popular cheese blintz casseroles made with frozen commercial blintzes. For my version, a layer of cheese filling is baked between two light layers of a special blintz-type batter.

The dish is served at the famous Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca, New York, where it has become a favorite brunch offering under the name \"Easy Cheese Blintz Puff.\" And the recipe has appeared in a number of books and magazines. Like some of the other \"creative\" recipes in this book, this one appears to be on its way to becoming a classic of \"new\" Jewish cooking.\n<a name=\"note\"></a>Notes: The types of cheese in the filling were determined after much experimentation with various mixtures.
