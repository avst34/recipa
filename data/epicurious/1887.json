The largest are called langostinos or langoustines, which are actually slim-bodied members of the lobster family. Red in color, their wide, heavier tails distinguish them from shrimp and prawns. The next in size is the red shrimp (crevette rose), which can be up to four inches in length. Red shrimp are difficult to transport alive, and are usually available boiled or frozen. Finally, North Sea prawns (crevette gris) are only about two inches in length and have an excellent, distinctive taste. The frozen shrimp and prawns that are sold in North American markets rarely provide the precise species or provenance of the product, which can come from any ocean.\nIn northern Spain it is most common to find the simple and classic preparation of shrimp or prawns quickly sautéed in a bit of garlic and olive oil. For a change, I created this shrimp marinade composed of common Mediterranean ingredients. This recipe is based on a technique to marinate shrimp with lemons, learned from Barry Morgenstern, a friend who trained at the famous Cordon Bleu in Paris. The marinade quickly infuses deeply into the hot shrimp, imparting bright flavors deep into each morsel. Once all the ingredients are assembled this is an extremely easy recipe, in which all the work can be done in advance.","hed":"Lemon Shrimp","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marina Chang"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lemon-shrimp-109505","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Spanish/Portuguese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.88,"ingredients":["Zest of 1 lemon","1/2 cup lemon juice, from approximately 2 large lemons","2 cloves garlic, crushed","1 tablespoon wine or sherry vinegar","2 tablespoons olive oil","12 black olives, kalamata or oil-cured, pitted, and halved","6 anchovy fillets, coarsely chopped","1 small red onion, thinly sliced","1 bay leaf, crumbled","Pinch of piment d'Espelette or cayenne powder","1 to 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp","2 to 3 teaspoons salt","1 ripe avocado, pitted, peeled, and sliced (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Prepare marinade in a large bowl by combining lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, vinegar, oil, olives, anchovies, red onion, bay leaf, and piment d'Espelette.","Peel and clean shrimp, leaving tails on.

The food writer Pepita Aris notes that there was a \"budinmania\" when la nueva cocina vasca became popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Inspired by la nouvelle cuisine in France, it readily took root in the Basque Country partly due to this region's abundant use of butter and cream, which is unique in Spain. This recipe is based on one by Karlos Arguiñano, talented chef and head of the Academia de Cocina in Zarautz, Spain.
