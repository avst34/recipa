Neil also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page. For your convenience, we've converted the measures — with as much accuracy as possible — from Australian to American. For those who have metric equipment and wish to follow Neil's recipe to the milliliter, we've included the original measures too.\nTo read more about Neil and Australian cuisine, click here.\nThis tart should be to Australians what lemon tart is to the Poms. If one fruit stands out in my mind as Australian it would have to be the passion fruit. Its intensity sets it apart from other fruits and, it is an ideal partner for cream and eggs. We cooked the Roux brothers' luscious lemon tart for many years at Rockpool and this tart draws its inspiration from that.\nChris Manfield runs the Paramount Restaurant in Sydney with Margie Harris, and makes a terrific passion fruit tart from a pastry shell filled with passion fruit curd. The food at the Paramount is extremely creative and delicious; Chris cooks in her own unique style and is one of the very best contemporary Australian chefs, but she is at her best and most creative when it comes to desserts. I see no need to serve cream with this tart.

If you take it out too soon it will not set and will run when you cut it; if you leave it in too long it will set too firmly and lose its elegance. Through experience you'll find the optimum set for the tart in your oven.","Remove the tart from the oven, balance on a cup and remove the sides. Put on a cake rack and, with a palette knife, slide the base off the tart tin. This will allow the tart to cool and the pastry to crisp up rather than sweat. Invert the pastry ring back onto the tart to help hold the sides in as it cools and sets. Allow to cool for 1 hour. Carefully cut with a serrated knife and place in the middle of large white plates.
