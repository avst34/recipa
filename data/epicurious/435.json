You can use brisket, shanks, shoulder—all fairly tough meats—but save the filet mignon for the grill or a pan.

Set a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat, lift the leeks from the water, drain, and add them to the pan. Season with salt and cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. As the leeks begin to soften, lower the heat to medium-low. The leeks will release liquid. Stir in the butter to emulsify, and season with pepper to taste. Cover the pan with a parchment lid, and cook, stirring every 10 minutes, until the leeks are very soft, 30 to 35 minutes. If at any point the butter breaks or looks oily, stir in about a tablespoon of water to re-emulsify the sauce.

In many ways, soul food is an apt description because there is a lot of soul and spirit and passion that goes into Low-Country cooking—dishes like she-crab soup, catfish stew, shrimp and grits, red rice, hoppin' John, and baked macaroni and cheese. No Low-Country feast would be complete without corn bread.\nMy version is steamed in a water bath to make the bread nice and moist; covering it with aluminum foil for the last thirty minutes of cooking gives you a nice crust that isn't overly browned. Paired with tomato chutney, it's a light snack or meal on its own.","hed":"Corn Bread with Tomato Chutney","pubDate":"2009-11-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marcus Samuelsson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/corn-bread-with-tomato-chutney-356391","photoData":{"id":"5609a7a062fa7a9917c25b48","filename":"356391_hires.jpg","caption":"Corn Bread with Tomato Chutney","credit":"Paul Brissman","promoTitle":"Corn Bread with Tomato Chutney","title":"Corn Bread with Tomato Chutney","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":1.67,"ingredients":["4 ears fresh corn, shucked","2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour","1 cup polenta","2 tablespoons baking powder","2 teaspoons salt","1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","1 teaspoon mild chili powder","1/4 teaspoon ground ginger","1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom","1 tablespoon black onion (nigella) seeds (see Tip)","2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar","2 poblano chiles, seeds and ribs removed, chopped","Butter to grease the pans","Tomato Chutney"],"prepSteps":["1.
