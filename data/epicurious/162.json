When available, Nilou prefers soft-shell lobsters, or shedders, for their easy-to-crack shells (no tools required!) and sweet, tender meat. If you choose soft-shell lobsters, reduce the cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes. She also prefers filtered seawater as a cooking liquid, so if your fishmonger has it available, give it a try! Boiling lobsters in well-salted water is the next best thing.","hed":"Tarragon Lobster Roll","pubDate":"2014-08-18T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rhoda Boone"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tarragon-lobster-roll-51245010","photoData":{"id":"54bad3b0e231becc7f3d436f","filename":"tarragon-lobster-roll-6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"photo by Rhoda Boone","promoTitle":"","title":"Tarragon Lobster Roll","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Sandwich","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.5,"ingredients":["Kosher salt","3 live Maine lobsters, 1 1/4 pound each","3 tablespoons mayonnaise, plus more if desired","2 tablespoons lemon juice","1/4 cup finely diced celery","1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon","Dash cayenne pepper, plus more to taste","1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","4 split-top, white hot dog buns","2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature"],"prepSteps":["Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt.
