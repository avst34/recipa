This was my favorite of their desserts, and it has since become a seasonal classic at Gramercy Tavern, though I've made a few adaptations and embellished a bit. My recipe has just a touch of cloves, and instead of just the ginger and cinnamon in a typical gingerbread, I use a panoply of spices, including cardamom, nutmeg, and a lot of fresh ginger, to give the cake a racy, intriguing flavor.\nThe most unusual thing about this recipe is that stout is substituted for the water or coffee used in most gingerbread recipes. I find it adds a lot of richness and underscores the spices. Since it is made with oil, this cake will stay moist for several days.

Add the compatability of maple and walnut to the equation and you'll see how I came up with this unusual dessert. To make it, I unmold a maple-syrup-sweetened flan directly into a baked walnut tart crust. The buttery crust acts as a moat, containing and absorbing the caramel that slides off the flan so that it doesn't have a chance to run all over your plate. Instead, you get all the rich, nutty flavors and creamy-crisp textures together in each bite. It's a completely satisfying dessert that takes flan to new heights.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when making it. The first is to try to use grade-B maple syrup, which has a stronger taste than grade A and is generally better for cooking (you can buy it at specialty shops). The next is to simmer and reduce the maple syrup to concentrate it, which makes a richer, more satiny custard. And the last is to bake the crust in a quiche pan rather than a tart shell. A quiche pan is made in one piece, so if there are small tears in the dough and the caramel drips through, it won’t leak all over your serving platter. A tart pan with a removable bottom is a much riskier proposition.\nIf you'd rather forego the tart shell, unmold the flan onto a platter and serve it with crisp cookies.","hed":"Maple Flan in a Walnut Crust","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Claudia Fleming"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/maple-flan-in-a-walnut-crust-105880","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.29,"ingredients":["1 cup maple syrup, preferably grade B","3 1/2 cups heavy cream","7 large egg yolks","1/8 teaspoon salt","1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar","1/2 teaspoon light corn syrup","Whipped crème fraîche for serving, optional","1/4 cup walnuts","1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened","1/3 cup confectioners' sugar","1 large egg, lightly beaten","1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour","1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons almond flour","1/2 teaspoon salt"],"prepSteps":["1. To prepare the flan, place the maple syrup in a large, heavy saucepan. Set it over low heat and let simmer until the syrup is reduced by a quarter (to 3/4 cup), 15 to 20 minutes.","2. Add the cream to the syrup and stir until mixture is smooth and comes back to a simmer.","3. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Add a little of the hot maple cream into the eggs to warm them, whisking constantly to keep the yolks from curdling. Pour the mixture into the saucepan, whisking the cream constantly. Strain the mixture into a bowl, stir in the salt, and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days.","4. Preheat oven to 300°F. Place 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, then add the sugar and corn syrup. Raise the heat to high and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the mixture becomes a dark amber caramel, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately pour the caramel into an 8-inch round nonstick cake pan, tilting to make sure the sides are well coated. Work quickly so the caramel doesn't harden. If it does, rewarm it over low heat.","5. Pour the maple custard into the caramel-coated cake pan. Place it in a baking pan and carefully move it to the oven rack. Pour enough very hot water into the baking pan to reach two thirds of the way up the side of the cake pan. Cover the baking pan with foil and prick all over with a fork. Bake the flan for about 1 hour, then lift off a corner of the foil to vent the steam. Re-cover the pan and continue to bake until the flan is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes longer. Remove the flan from the baking pan and transfer to a rack. Let cool at room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight.","6. To prepare the walnut crust, preheat oven to 350°F. Spread the nuts out on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven, stirring once or twice, until they smell nutty, about 10 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool.","7. Using a food processor, pulse the walnuts until they are finely ground, then reserve. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and confectioners' sugar until combined, about 1 minute. Beat in the egg. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, almond flour, walnuts, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 2 batches, scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions. Mix until the dough just holds together. Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and form it into a disk. Wrap it and chill for at least 1 hour, until firm.","8. Preheat oven to 325°F.
