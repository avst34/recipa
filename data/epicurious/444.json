It brings lots of complex flavor to anything that it is spread on.\nBaccalà mantecato is important to our family, though, for more than its addictive savor. It is a link to Istria, my native region, where the imminent arrival of Christmas at our house (and everyone else's) was scented by the unmistakable vapors of dried codfish, cooking for hours and hours. These were not fish from our local waters, but a delicacy from Northern Europe, a fish that was brought in to be bartered and exchanged for olive oil and good Mediterranean wine, carefully selected and dearly bought. But despite the expense, or the time and labor in its preparation, baccalà mantecato was the mark of a good cook in Istria, and many would stop in at a particular house not just for the hoilday greetings but also for a taste of the baccalà.\nIn our household, my father was the chief cook of baccalà mantecato—it was his one culinary triumph—and that makes it all the more special to me. Though he has been gone for many years, his masterful touch with this dish remains with me and inspires me; every time I make it now, I remember him, with every bite.","hed":"Baccalà Mantecato: A Savory Spread of Whipped Salt Cod","pubDate":"2009-10-15T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lidia Matticchio Bastianich"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/baccala-mantecato-a-savory-spread-of-whipped-salt-cod-355908","photoData":{"id":"5609a762e0acd286555dba66","filename":"355908.jpg","caption":"Baccalà Mantecato: A Savory Spread of Whipped Salt Cod","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Baccalà Mantecato: A Savory Spread of Whipped Salt Cod","title":"Baccalà Mantecato: A Savory Spread of Whipped Salt Cod","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.8,"ingredients":["1 pound boneless baccalà (salt cod), soaked to remove salt","1 medium russet potato (about 1/2 pound)","2 plump garlic cloves, finely minced","1 cup extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 cup half-and-half or light cream","1/2 cup poaching water from cooking the baccalà","freshly ground black pepper to taste","A heavy-duty electric mixer with the paddle attachment or a food processor"],"prepSteps":["When the baccalà is sufficiently soaked, cut it into small pieces—6 inches or so—and put them in a saucepan or deep skillet with at least an inch of water to cover.

Increase the speed and beat until the whites begin to mound and hold their shape. While whipping, gradually add 10 tablespoons of the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Once you've added all the sugar, beat until stiff.","5. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the fromage blanc mixture, then fold in the remaining egg whites just until incorporated. It's okay to have some tiny bits of white; that's preferable to overfolding the batter.","6. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish, gently smooth the top, and sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.","7. Bake on a middle rack (or slightly higher, if possible) for 30 minutes, until the top is browned and the soufflé is just set but still very jiggly in the center if you nudge it. Depending on your oven, this may take slightly less or more time. Rather than going by strict baking times, touch the center to tell when it's done. If you like your soufflé creamy in the middle, the center should feel rather soft, like runny pudding.","If you like it more firm, you can bake it until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out pretty clean."],"reviewsCount":2,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a42fa36529d92b2c0133eb","dek":"This fall soup is like putting on the first sweater of the season: it just feels so good. Although the soup takes several steps—roasting the squash and pears (which can be done a day ahead of time), cooking them, and finally pureeing the soup—none involve much from you. It's an easily made soup that will keep well for days—a great possibility for a holiday meal.","hed":"Deborah Madison's Roasted Squash, Pear, and Ginger Soup","pubDate":"2009-10-15T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Deborah Madison"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/deborah-madisons-roasted-squash-pear-and-ginger-soup-355879","photoData":{"id":"5609a75962fa7a9917c25a8c","filename":"355879.jpg","caption":"Deborah Madison's Roasted Squash, Pear, and Ginger Soup","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Deborah Madison's Roasted Squash, Pear, and Ginger Soup","title":"Deborah Madison's Roasted Squash, Pear, and Ginger Soup","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.42,"ingredients":["One 2 1/2-pound Buttercup, Perfection, or other dense winter squash, rinsed","3 ripe but firm pears, any variety, quartered, seeds and stems removed","1 chunk fresh ginger, about 2 inches long, thinly sliced","Sunflower seed or olive oil for the squash","Sea salt","2 tablespoons butter or sunflower seed oil","1 onion, thinly sliced","1/2 cup crème fraîche or sour cream, optional"],"prepSteps":["1.

There's a little going back and forth between the skillet and a food processor, but this is an easy dish to make.
