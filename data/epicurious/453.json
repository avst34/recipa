First, I want to use a salt that is 100 percent sodium chloride, without any additives such as calcium silicate, an anti-caking agent, or potassium iodide, a nutritional supplement, both of which I find detract from the salt's flavor. Second, salts have widely varying densities; for example, 2/3 cup of Diamond Crystal salt weighs 3 ounces (85 grams) while 2/3 cup of Morton's kosher salt weighs 5.25 ounces (149 grams), and the same volume of Morton's table salt weighs 6.5 ounces (185 grams)—more than double the weight of the Diamond Crystal! As a result, a brine using table salt may be more than twice as salty as one using the same amount of Diamond Crystal. Now readily available in the spice section of most supermarkets and gourmet grocers, Diamond Crystal is packaged in a bright red box with black lettering. You can substitute any brand of salt, as long as it is pure sodium chloride and you use a weight of 3 ounces (irrespective of volume).","hed":"Juniper Brine","pubDate":"2009-09-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Diane Morgan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/juniper-brine-355429","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Berry","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["2/3 cup (3 ounces or 85 grams) Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt","2/3 cup sugar","6 whole cloves","1 teaspoon juniper berries, crushed (see Cook's Note)","1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed (see Cook's Note)","2 teaspoons whole allspice berries, crushed (see Cook's Note)","5 fresh sage leaves","4 sprigs fresh thyme","2 bay leaves","8 cups hot water","4 cups ice water"],"prepSteps":["In a large saucepan, stir together the salt, sugar, cloves, juniper berries, peppercorns, and allspice.

Sprinkle the pans with flour, tap the pans to evenly distribute the flour, and then shake off the excess flour. Set aside.","To make the cake, in a large bowl, sift together the 2 cups flour, the granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, oil, and vanilla. In another medium bowl, combine the pumpkin purée, coconut, crushed pineapple, and currants.","Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Add the pumpkin mixture and stir just until combined. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, spreading it evenly. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. Transfer to wire racks and let cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cakes. Invert the cakes onto the racks and peel off the parchment paper. Let cool completely before frosting the cakes.","To make the frosting, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed for about 3 minutes until smooth. Add the butter and beat for about 2 minutes until combined. Add the pumpkin purée and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla and beat for about 3 minutes until fluffy.","Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or platter. Using an offset spatula, spread half of the frosting over the top of the first cake layer. Spread the frosting right to the edge of the top without frosting the sides of the cake. Carefully place the second cake on top, lining up the edges. Spread the remaining frosting over the top of the cake without frosting the sides. Swirl the frosting to decorate the top. Refrigerate the cake to set the frosting. Remove from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before serving."],"reviewsCount":51,"willMakeAgainPct":96},{"id":"54a429236529d92b2c00dfd9","dek":"Editor's note: Use these instructions to make Diane Morgan's Juniper-Brined Roast Turkey with Chanterelle Mushroom Gravy\nThis method involves brining the bird in turkey oven bags set in a roasting pan.

Place the double bag, mouth open wide and facing up, in the roasting pan.","Fold back the top one-third of the double bag to make a collar (this helps keep the bags open). Place the turkey inside the double bag. Unfold the collar of the double bag and pour the brine over the bird, then add 2 cups of cold water. Draw up the top of the inner bag, squeezing out as much air as possible, and secure it closed with a twist tie. Do the same with the outer bag. Turn the package so the turkey is breast side down in the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 12 and up to 24 hours. Turn the turkey 3 or 4 times while it is brining.","Remove the turkey from the brine. Discard the bags, brine, and any cured herbs or spices remaining on the bird. Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place the turkey back in the roasting pan and refrigerate, unwrapped, for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. This resting period allows the skin of the turkey to dry a bit so it is crisp when roasted. The turkey is now ready to be roasted.","Plastic oven bags (made by Reynolds) are found with other food storage bags at supermarkets. Buy the turkey-sized bags. They are food-safe, plus they are big, strong, tear-resistant, and come with twist ties. Do not use plastic garbage bags, as they are not intended for food storage. I use a double thickness of bags as a precautionary measure against leakage. For the same reason, I place the bagged turkey in a roasting pan."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"54a429226529d92b2c00dfbf","dek":"There is no such thing as too many starchy dishes on the holiday buffet table, right? For many families, Thanksgiving dinner wouldn't be right without mashed potatoes. It seems there is always one family member relegated to the task of whipping them at the last minute—an honorable duty. And there is always someone else leaning over his shoulder making sure he adds a bit more butter. If you want to assign mashed potato duty to a family member, but would like to avoid the last minute chaos in the kitchen, know that it works perfectly well to cook and mash potatoes up to 1 hour in advance. They can be kept warm in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, or reheated in a microwave oven just before serving. If you use the do-ahead plan, be sure to add an extra pat of butter, or two!","hed":"Classic Mashed Potatoes","pubDate":"2009-09-16T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Diane Morgan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/classic-mashed-potatoes-355449","photoData":{"id":"5609a6276a59cdb91b5ff640","filename":"355449_hires.jpg","caption":"Classic Mashed Potatoes","credit":"John A.
