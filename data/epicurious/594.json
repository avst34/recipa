Imagine my excitement, then, when my friend Celeste Tonon, proprietor of Ristorante da Celeste, passed on to me the original procedures for making this luscious assemblage of ladyfingers (savoiardi) and Mascarpone cream, which Celeste learned from his mentor Speranza Garatti, the true mother of tiramisù, he claims. Her creation was made and served in individual portions, in a goblet or coppa, which I suspect gave rise to its name, which means \"pick me up\" in the Venetian dialect.\nOne of the delights of making tiramisù is its versatility. This recipe makes a family-style dessert in a large dish, but you can easily compose single servings in dessert glasses, wine goblets, or even elegant teacups for a more impressive presentation, in the style of Signora Garatti's original \"coppa imperiale.\" And while the conventional version of tiramisù calls for espresso-soaked savoiardi, I've found that other flavors can be incorporated into the dessert with great success. Here, the brightness of fresh lemons and limoncello liqueur lace the cream and soaking syrup to make for a tiramisù that is refreshing and irresistible.","hed":"Limoncello Tiramisu (Tiramisu al Limoncello)","pubDate":"2008-02-04T20:43:46.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lidia Bastianich"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/limoncello-tiramisu-em-tiramisu-al-limoncello-em-241708","photoData":{"id":"560d78107b55306961bf3300","filename":"241708.jpg","caption":"Limoncello Tiramisu (Tiramisu al Limoncello)","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Limoncello Tiramisu (Tiramisu al Limoncello)","title":"Limoncello Tiramisu (Tiramisu al Limoncello)","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.69,"ingredients":["5 large eggs","5 or 6 lemons","1 cup sugar","1 1/2 cups limoncello liqueur","1 cup water","1 pound (2 cups) Mascarpone, at room temperature","40 ladyfingers (preferably imported Italian savoiardi), or more as needed","A double boiler, with a large stainless-steel bowl and a wide saucepan to hold it; a large flexible wire whisk; a shallow-rimmed pan for moistening the savoiardi with syrup","","","For assembling the tiramisù: a shallow casserole or baking dish with 3-quart capacity, such as a 9-by-13-inch Pyrex pan"],"prepSteps":["Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan.

Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.","To make the base for the tiramisù, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup of the limoncello until well blended. Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer.

Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.","In another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks.","When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.","Pour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi).

In the yum chat (dim-sum dining) culture, these sticky-sweet treats are eaten between savory bites throughout the meal. Traditionally, the dough is made only with glutinous rice flour, which is quite sticky and will leave you searching for a toothpick. I add taro to make the dough more tender, more tasty, and a lovely shade of lavender. I substitute flavorful figs for the traditional lotus seed and red bean fillings.\nCHEF'S TIPS: In Chinese cooking, sesame seeds are never deeply browned— their white color symbolizes purity. Be sure to start with untoasted white sesame seeds for a light golden color when the balls are done.\nMost fried desserts are best eaten right away, but these stay delicious and crisp even at room temperature.","hed":"Sesame Balls with Drunken Fig Filling","pubDate":"2008-01-30T15:59:46.000Z","author":[{"name":"Pichet Ong"},{"name":"Genevieve Ko"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sesame-balls-with-drunken-fig-filling-241655","photoData":{"id":"560d780bf3a00aeb2f1cb464","filename":"241655_hires.jpg","caption":"Sesame Balls with Drunken Fig Filling","credit":"Pate Eng","promoTitle":"Sesame Balls with Drunken Fig Filling","title":"Sesame Balls with Drunken Fig Filling","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Chinese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.11,"ingredients":["2 1/4 cups (15 3/4 ounces/448grams) dried figs, preferably Black Mission, stemmed and quartered","1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces/98 grams) sugar","1 teaspoon salt","1/4 cup (2 ounces/56 grams) cognac or dark rum","1 cup (7 ounces/200 grams) sugar","1 tablespoon salt","1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda","5 1/3 ounces (150 grams) taro, deeply peeled and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices","3 1/2 cups (16 1/8 ounces/462 grams) glutinous rice flour","Canola, vegetable, or other neutral oil for deep-frying","1 cup (3 3/8 ounces/96 grams) white sesame seeds"],"prepSteps":["1. To make the drunken fig filling: Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir well to coat the figs with the sugar. Cover and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or as long as overnight.","2. Transfer the figs and liquid to the bowl of a food processor or an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Process or beat the mixture until mashed to a paste. (You can also mash the mixture by hand with a fork.) Cover and refrigerate until ready to use; the filling can be kept for up to 2 weeks.","3. To make the sesame balls: Put the sugar, salt, and baking soda into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix well; set aside.","4. Fill a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket or rack with water to a dept of 2 inches and bring to a rolling boil. Put the taro in the basket and steam until very soft, about 10 minutes; it should fall apart if poked with a knife. Immediately add the taro to the sugar mixture, and beat on medium speed until smooth and pasty, about 5 minutes.","5. Meanwhile, bring 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water to boil.","6. Turn the mixer speed to low and add the glutinous rice flour. When the mixture is crumbly, add the boiling water all at once. (The water must be boiling when added.) Continue beating until the dough is soft and only slightly sticky. Squeeze the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and set aside until it cools to room temperature.","7. Shape the dough into a log 1 inch in diameter, and cut the log into 2-inch lengths. One at a time, flatten each piece of dough with your palm into a circle 4 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Put 1 tablespoon of the chilled fig filling into the center of the circle, then bring the edges together to form a half-moon and pinch to seal.

Fill a shallow dish with 1/8 inch of water and another shallow dish with the sesame seeds. Roll a sesame ball in the water, just enough to moisten, then roll in the sesame seeds until well coated. Press the seeds so they stick to the balls, if necessary. Carefully lower the coated ball into the oil and cook, without stirring, until it floats and is crisp and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. You can cook about 8 balls at a time, but do not overcrowd the pan. Carefully remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining balls.
