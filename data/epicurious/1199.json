A staple of the islanders' diet was the wild hog. The locals called the animals boucan, and that French word eventually came to be applied to many of the wild seafaring island men: buccaneers.\nBarbecue has become one of the world's favorite foods; few culinary subjects stir such rabid debate, from Texas to Memphis to South Carolina and on down to the Caribbean and South America. Barbecue as we have come to love it — using marinades and/or sauces and carefully slow-cooking — was perfected in the Caribbean. But some food scholars theorize that barbecue may have originated by accident in China many centuries ago, when a devastating fire burned down a barn, and the pig farmers, who had previously never cooked meat in a fiery fashion, smelled solace in their loss and as a consequence ate well that night. No less an authority on food than Waverly Root stated that cooking in this fashion was \"so natural under primitive circumstances that it would practically invent itself everywhere, especially in societies accustomed to living outdoors most of the time.\"\nIf you aren't familiar with country ribs, this recipe will introduce you to the cut, also known as split blade chops.

Add the cucumbers and allow to marinate for about 15 minutes.","To serve, arrange the cucumber in neat slices across each plate. Slice the tuna and lay it over the cucumbers. Spoon the avocado salsa on top of or around the tuna. Spoon a little of the pickling juices around the cucumbers, and serve. (Sometimes I add a little grated orange zest for garnish as well.)","Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.","Rub each of the tuna steaks with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil and sprinkle generously with the adobo. (Reserve any extra adobo spice rub for another use.) In a nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until it begins to smoke. Sear the tuna on each side for only 1 minute — the tuna is served rare. Transfer to a plate and set aside.","Recommended wine: A cold-pressed sake would be an unexpected but welcome accompaniment."],"reviewsCount":83,"willMakeAgainPct":95},{"id":"54a44b746529d92b2c01c400","dek":"","hed":"Morels in Cream on Brioche (Morilles à la Crème)","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/morels-in-cream-on-brioche-morilles-a-la-creme-105005","photoData":{"id":"560ea812f9a84192308a9b13","filename":"105005.jpg","caption":"Morels in Cream on Brioche (Morilles à la Crème)","credit":"Romulo Yanes","promoTitle":"Morels in Cream on Brioche (Morilles à la Crème)","title":"Morels in Cream on Brioche (Morilles à la Crème)","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.83,"ingredients":["1 cup heavy cream","3 tablespoons unsalted butter","1 pound fresh morels, trimmed, washed well, and patted dry","1 tablespoon all-purpose flour","Freshly ground white pepper","5 thin slices brioche or challah bread, crusts discarded, each slice cut into 4 triangles and toasted"],"prepSteps":["Heat cream in a small saucepan until hot.","Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté morels, stirring frequently, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.
