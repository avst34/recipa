Luckily, my husband, Loren, likes to cook as much as I do, so we really work as a team when we give dinner parties. We're both real estate agents, and we like to entertain clients — we've made some great friends by selling houses to them.\"\nSilky and light, this blender soup would make a delicate summer starter. Bonus: It comes together very quickly.","hed":"Crab and Avocado Soup","pubDate":"2004-08-20T12:48:48.000Z","author":[{"name":"Sally Siegel"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/crab-and-avocado-soup-106933","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter","1 cup chopped onion","3 tablespoons all purpose flour","2 8-ounce bottles clam juice","1 1/2 cups canned low-salt chicken broth","1/2 cup half and half","2 medium avocados, peeled, pitted, diced","4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro","1 tablespoon minced seeded jalapeño chili","1 tablespoon fresh lime juice","1/2 pound crabmeat, flaked, picked over"],"prepSteps":["Melt butter in large pot over medium-high heat.
