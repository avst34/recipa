Preserved as a living history museum, today's Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill illuminates their traditions and creations, including woodworking, farming, spinning, and stonework. Their restaurants serve this signature confection, Shaker Lemon Pie.\nFor those of us who adore lemons, it is magnificent, and if you simply appreciate thrift and culinary creativity, you'll admire its unique approach. The issue is its pithy-ness. Shaker lemon pie uses the entire lemon, from yellow peel through white pith and all the way to the interior seeds. This means slicing two whole lemons absolutely paper thin, and macerating them for hours in sugar. The resulting pie includes a subtle sharp flavor from the pith, and the texture tends toward the chewy side, but it all works for the aforementioned lemon-lovers like myself. For my version, I chop the thinly sliced lemons coarsely, so that despite my uneven slicing, the lemon pieces are bite sized. I also add a little flour, to thicken the juices a bit. Plan ahead, so that you can set the mixture of very thinly sliced lemons and sugar aside for at least three hours and ideally, overnight. This makes for a softer texture and profoundly lemony flavor in your pie.","hed":"Shaker Lemon Pie","pubDate":"2010-10-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nancie McDermott"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/shaker-lemon-pie-361949","photoData":{"id":"54b326e5460b4423363eedb9","filename":"361949_shaker-lemon-pie_1x1.jpg","caption":"Shaker Lemon Pie","credit":"Leigh Beisch","promoTitle":"Shaker Lemon Pie","title":"Shaker Lemon Pie","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.13,"ingredients":["2 medium lemons","2 cups sugar","Pastry for a 9-inch single-crust pie, such as Barry Maiden's Butter/Shortening Piecrust","4 eggs, beaten well","2 tablespoons all-purpose flour","1/4 teaspoon salt"],"prepSteps":["Using your sharpest knife (a serrated knife is ideal), trim each lemon to remove the stem end and tip.

Given my deep affection for egg custard, pumpkin, and sweet potato pies, it's no surprise that I would adore bean pie, which shares culinary roots with those pie favorites. Developed in the 1930s as part of the nutritional teachings of the Nation of Islam, bean pies became standard items at black Muslim bakeries in urban communities from Chicago and Oakland to Detroit and Washington, D.C. Navy beans are most commonly cited in recipes, but great northern beans and pinto beans are also popular choices. With a can of beans and the usual custard pie ingredients, you can turn out a delicious bean pie fast. You can use a blender or a food processor to mix up your filling, or mash the cooked, drained beans well with a potato masher or a fork.","hed":"Bean Pie","pubDate":"2010-10-19T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nancie McDermott"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/bean-pie-361909","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["Pastry for a 9-inch single-crust pie, such as Barry Maiden's Butter/Shortening Piecrust","1 cup sugar","1 tablespoon flour","1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg","1/2 cup evaporated milk or half-and-half","1/4 cup butter, melted","2 eggs","1 tablespoon vanilla extract","1 cup mashed, cooked navy beans"],"prepSteps":["Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.
