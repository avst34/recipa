They cook in minutes and have a delightfully slippery mouthfeel. In Sichuan, the source of this recipe, they are known as \"folded arms\" (chao shou). Some say this is because the raw dumplings look like the folded arms of a person sitting back in relaxation; others that it's because of the way they are wrapped, with one corner crossed over the other and the two pinched together. The basic wontons can be served in a host of different ways and this Chengdu version is one of my favorites, with its sumptuous, heart-warming sauce.\nWonton skins can be bought fresh or frozen in most Chinese food shops; they should be very thin and supple. If you want to take the easiest option in wrapping the dumplings, you can simply fold them in half, on the diagonal, to make a triangle. Otherwise, wrap into classic \"water caltrop\" shape, as professional cooks and market vendors do across China. (The water caltrop is an exotic-looking aquatic nut with a pair of horns.) This recipe makes 15-20, enough for four as an appetizer, or two for lunch. If you use fresh ingredients and make more than you need, the surplus can be frozen and cooked straight from the freezer.","hed":"Sichuanese Wontons in Chilli Oil Sauce (Hong You Chao Shou)","pubDate":"2013-02-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Fuchsia Dunlop"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sichuanese-wontons-in-chilli-oil-sauce-em-hong-you-chao-shou-em-51147600","photoData":{"id":"54cd1bdc1f13bb9b2edfc224","filename":"SichuaneseWontonsinChilliOilSauce_6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chris Terry","promoTitle":"","title":"Sichuanese Wontons in Chilli Oil Sauce","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Chinese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1/2 oz (20g) piece of ginger, unpeeled","5 oz (150g) ground pork","1/2 egg, beaten","1 tsp Shaoxing wine","1/2 tsp sesame oil","Salt","Ground white pepper","3 tbsp chicken stock","3 tbsp finely sliced spring onion greens","7 oz (200g) package of wonton wrappers","Flour, to dust","3-4 tbsp sweet aromatic soy sauce, or 3-4 tbsp light or tamari soy sauce with 1 1/2-2 tsp sugar","5-6 tbsp chilli oil, with its sediment","2-4 heaped tsp crushed garlic","2 tbsp finely sliced spring onion greens"],"prepSteps":["Crush the ginger with the flat of a cleaver or a rolling pin and put it in a cup with just enough cold water to cover.

Years later—and having eaten it countless times in the Sichuanese capital Chengdu—it remains one of my favorite fish dishes, and everyone else seems to love it too. The fish lies in a spectacular sauce, a deep rusty red in color, sumptuously spicy and aromatic with ginger and garlic. In Sichuan, they tend to make it with carp. Back home in London, I've made it with sea bass, whole trout and fillets and, more recently, with organic mirror carp. They all taste delicious. (As with many Sichuanese dishes, the soul of the recipe lies in the combination of flavors and you can be flexible about the main ingredient, which is one reason why Sichuanese cuisine travels so well.) I'm particularly happy that the recipe works so well with mirror carp, one of the most sustainable fish and ripe for revival in places such as Britain, where it has long fallen out of favor.\nYou will probably find that the fish disintegrates slightly during cooking. Don't worry: you can arrange it neatly on the serving plate and pour the sauce over it. And when your guests taste it, if my experiences are anything to go by, they'll be so overcome with rapture that they won't care what it looks like.","hed":"Braised Trout in Chilli Bean Sauce (Dou Ban Yu)","pubDate":"2013-02-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Fuchsia Dunlop"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/braised-trout-in-chilli-bean-sauce-em-dou-ban-yu-em-51147400","photoData":{"id":"56005d4ebd6b8b837d72d3ed","filename":"51147400_braised-trout-in-chilli.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chris Terry","promoTitle":"","title":"51147400 braised-trout-in-chilli.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["1 rainbow trout (about 3/4 lb/350g), scaled and cleaned, but with head and tail intact","Salt","1 tbsp Shaoxing wine","1/2 cup (100ml) cooking oil, plus 2-3 tbsp more","2 1/2 tbsp Sichuan chilli bean paste","2 tsp finely chopped ginger","4 tsp finely chopped garlic","3/4 cup (200ml) chicken stock","1 tsp light soy sauce, to taste","2 tsp potato flour dissolved in 1 1/2 tbsp cold water","","3-4 tbsp finely sliced spring onion greens","1 tsp sesame oil"],"prepSteps":["Make three even, diagonal cuts into the thickest part of each side of the fish, to allow the sauce to penetrate.

Every region seems to have its own version: this is my favorite, based on recipes I've gathered in eastern China. If my experience is anything to go by, you won't have any leftovers. My guests tend to finish every last morsel and usually end up scraping the pot. If your guests are more restrained, leftover red-braised pork keeps very well for a few days in the refrigerator and a good spoonful makes a wonderful topping for a bowl of noodles. I don't recommend freezing it, however, as this ruins the delicate texture of the fat.\nThis recipe will serve four to six as part of a Chinese meal. To make it go further, add more stock or water and a vegetarian ingredient that will soak up the sauce most deliciously. Puffy, deep-fried tofu is a fine addition to red-braised pork, as are hard-boiled eggs, dried tofu \"bamboo\" and the little knotted strips of dried tofu skin that can be found in some Chinese supermarkets (the latter two should first be soaked in hot water until supple). In rural households in China, they often add dried vegetables such as string beans and bamboo shoots, which should also be pre-soaked. You can also use root vegetables such as potato, taro or carrot, or peeled water chestnuts: just make sure you cook the vegetables with the pork for long enough to absorb its flavors, and adjust the seasoning as necessary.\nTo reduce the amount of oil in the final dish, make it in advance and refrigerate overnight. Then scrape off the layer of fat on the surface and keep it in the refrigerator to add to your stir-fried mushrooms or other vegetables. If you prefer a less fatty cut, pork ribs or shoulder are also magnificent red-braised. And you can, if you like, cook the pork slowly in an oven instead of on the burner—not very Chinese, but often more convenient (for this, preheat the oven to 300°F/150°C/gas mark 2).","hed":"Red-Braised Pork (Hong Shao Rou)","pubDate":"2013-02-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Fuchsia Dunlop"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/red-braised-pork-em-hong-shao-rou-em-51147410","photoData":{"id":"56005e49d296e7ab46e9dc84","filename":"51147410_red-braised-pork.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chris Terry","promoTitle":"","title":"51147410 red-braised-pork.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Asian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 1/4 lb (500g) boneless pork belly, with skin, or shoulder","2 tbsp cooking oil","4 slices of unpeeled ginger","1 spring onion, white part only, crushed slightly","2 tbsp Shaoxing wine","2 cups plus 2 tbsp (500ml) chicken stock or water, plus more if needed","1 star anise","Small piece of cassia bark or cinnamon stick","Dash of dark soy sauce","2 tbsp sugar","Salt, to taste","A few lengths of spring onion greens, to garnish"],"prepSteps":["Cut the pork into 3/4-1 in (2-3cm) chunks.","Pour the oil into a seasoned wok over a high flame, followed by the ginger and spring onion and stir-fry until you can smell their aromas.
