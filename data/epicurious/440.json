the pasta dough into thin wide sheets, and briefly cook them.","In separate saucepans, warm the besciamella and the Bolognese slightly, so they are loose and spreadable but not hot.","If you are going to bake the pasticciata right away, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 375°.","Coat the bottom and sides of the dish thinly with 1/3 cup besciamella.","Spread 1/3 cup Bolognese on the bottom, over the besciamella.","Following the illustrations, drape pasta sheets the length of the pan so that they cover the bottom of the dish completely and extend over the short sides of the pan by 6 inches or so.","Spread 1/3 cup besciamella over the pasta.","Spread 1/3 cup Bolognese over the besciamella.","Drape pasta sheets perpendicular to the first, across the width of the pan, with the ends of the sheets extending over the sides of the pan by 6 inches or so. Pasta sheets should now completely hide the sides of the pan.","Spread 2/3 cup besciamella over the pasta. Sprinkle 1/4 cup grated cheese all over. Spread 1 cup Bolognese in a thick layer. Cover with a third of the Muenster or mozzarella, shredded or in slices.","Fit another layer of pasta on top, covering only the inside of the pan now, cutting sheets if necessary to fit. Create another thick filling layer with 2/3 cup besciamella, 1/4 cup grated cheese, 1 cup Bolognese, and another third of shredded cheese.","Make another layer of pasta sheets, cut to fit, and top with a final filling layer (2/3 cup besciamella, 1/4 cup grated cheese, 1 cup Bolognese, and the last third of the shredded cheese).","Arrange another layer of pasta over the filling, cut to fit.","Spread 1/3 cup besciamella over the pasta, and sprinkle 2 tablespoons grated cheese all over.","Repeat with a final layer of pasta, then besciamella, and then grated cheese.","Fold all the overhanging flaps of pasta onto the top of the pasticciata.","If they don't meet and cover the top, cut a piece of pasta to fit, or use all the remaining pasta here.","Spread the rest of the besciamella and Bolognese on, and sprinkle 2 tablespoons grated cheese all over.","If you want, you can bake the pasticciata later, or the next day, covering it with plastic wrap and refrigerating it in the meantime.","Before putting it in the oven, tear a long sheet of foil to form a tent over the pan. This will give the insides time to cook before the top browns. Arch the foil so it doesn't touch the pasticciata anywhere, and crimp it against the rim and outsides of the pan so it stays in place and has formed a good seal. With the tip of a sharp knife, poke five or six small holes in the foil to vent steam.","Set the pan on a baking sheet, put it in the oven, and bake for about 45 minutes, or until bubbling juices indicate that it's cooking all the way through—peek under the foil to check. Take the pan (on the baking sheet) out of the oven to remove the foil tent.","Loosen foil at the sides and lift it up carefully, so it doesn't touch the sticky top of the pasticciata.

This recipe makes a family-style dessert in a large dish, but you can easily compose single servings in dessert glasses, wine goblets, or even elegant teacups for a more impressive presentation, in the style of Signora Garatti's original \"coppa imperiale.\" And while the conventional version of tiramisù calls for espresso soaked savoiardi, I've found that other flavors can be incorporated into the dessert with great success. Here, the brightness of fresh lemons and limoncello liqueur lace the cream and soaking syrup to make for a tiramisù that is refreshing and irresistible.","hed":"Limoncello Tiramisù","pubDate":"2009-10-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Lidia Matticchio Bastianich"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/limoncello-tiramisu-355932","photoData":{"id":"5609a76862fa7a9917c25ac8","filename":"355932.jpg","caption":"Limoncello Tiramisù","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Limoncello Tiramisù","title":"Limoncello Tiramisù","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["5 large eggs","5 or 6 lemons","1 cup sugar","1 1/2 cups limoncello liqueur","1 cup water","1 pound (2 cups) mascarpone, at room temperature","40 ladyfingers (preferably imported Italian savoiardi), or more as needed"],"prepSteps":["Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan. Separate the eggs, putting yolks into the large bowl of the double boiler and the whites into another stainless-steel bowl for whipping by hand or with an electric mixer.","Remove the zest of two or more of the lemons, using a fine grater, to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.","To make the base for the tiramisù, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and ± cup of the limoncello until well blended.","Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface, take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.","Meanwhile, pour the remaining cup of limoncello, all of the lemon juice, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan.","Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.","In another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks. When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.","Pour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie briefly—if it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.","Scoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream. Smooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramisù airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours.
