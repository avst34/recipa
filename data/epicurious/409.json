Or, if you have a neighbor with one, you're bound to find a bag of persimmons on your doorstep one fall day. The prolific trees are especially striking when the leaves drop and the traffic-stopping bright-orange orbs are still clinging to the bare, gnarled branches, silhouetted against a clear autumn sky.\nEven if you don't have a tree, or a neighboring one that you can benefit from, you might have seen persimmons at the market. Most likely they were Hachiya persimmons, the most common, elongated-shape variety. It's the one I recommend for this cake. They must be squishy soft before they can be used. If you buy them rock-hard, leave them at room temperature until they feel like water balloons ready to burst. When ready, yank off the stem, slice each persimmon in half, then scoop out the jellylike pulp and purée it in a blender or food processor.","hed":"Persimmon Cake with Cream Cheese Icing","pubDate":"2010-04-28T06:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David Lebovitz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/persimmon-cake-with-cream-cheese-icing-358789","photoData":{"id":"583f3478b80c02a24264c1c9","filename":"persimmon-cake-with-cream-cheese-icing.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"persimmon-cake-with-cream-cheese-icing.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cake","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.75,"ingredients":["3/4 cup (120 g) dried currants","1/4 cup (60 ml) brandy or whiskey","2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour","2 teaspoons baking soda","1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon","3/4 teaspoon salt","1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg","1 2/3 cups (355 g) granulated sugar","3/4 cup (6 ounces/170 g) unsalted butter, melted","1 1/2 cups (375 ml) persimmon purée","3 large eggs, at room temperature","2 teaspoons vanilla extract","1 1/2 cups (150 g) walnuts or pecans, toasted and finely chopped","4 ounces (115 g) cream cheese","1 tablespoon salted butter, at room temperature","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice","2/3 cup (90 g) powdered sugar, sifted","4 or 5 teaspoons water"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

My curiosity piqued, I placed an order with the waiter, only to have him come back with \"You won't like it. Order something else.\" Not one to be easily swayed from ordering an intriguing dessert, I ordered it in spite of his admonition, and you know what? I liked it—quite a bit, in fact.\nWith that experience in mind, when I saw a fresh fennel cake on a dessert menu at a fancy three-star Michelin restaurant, I didn't hesitate to order it. I had high hopes and was ready for anything. But so was the waiter, who informed me as he set it down that if I didn't like it, he'd replace it with something else. He saw my expression after I took my first bite, and he briskly returned to the table to make good on his offer.\nStill, I do believe in giving a chance to things that are out of the ordinary, otherwise, how would we discover new flavors and tastes? I haven't gotten around to trying to come up with my own version of an eggplant dessert (and I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to come up with a fresh fennel one, either), but I've made these tomato jam-filled cookies many times and not once have I had to rush over to offer guests anything in their place.","hed":"Rosemary Cookies with Tomato Jam","pubDate":"2010-04-28T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David Lebovitz"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rosemary-cookies-with-tomato-jam-358790","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cookies","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.72,"ingredients":["2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour","1/4 cup (40 g) stone-ground yellow cornmeal or polenta","1/2 teaspoon salt","1 cup (8 ounces/225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature","10 tablespoons (135 g) sugar","2 large egg yolks","1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves","Tomato Jam"],"prepSteps":["In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, and salt.","In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a bowl by hand), beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed just until smooth.

Jose has long since retired to his little pueblo in Michoacan, but his recipe lives on in my kitchen simply because it so delicious. Pork cooked this way is moist and succulent, sweet from the natural caramelization of the milk, with the slightest hint of orange and black pepper. For an over-the-top garnish, crumble chicharrón (fried pork skin) on the soft roast meat for a porky, crunchy textural contrast. Serve the carnitas with warm corn tortillas, avocado, a crisp raw tomatillo salsa, and plenty of onions and cilantro. If you have access to heirloom pork such as Kurobuta or Berkshire, it's exceptionally delicious—pork the way pork was meant to taste.","hed":"Tacos of Carnitas Roasted with Orange, Milk, and Pepper","pubDate":"2010-04-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Deborah Schneider"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tacos-of-carnitas-roasted-with-orange-milk-and-pepper-358749","photoData":{"id":"56098eeb6a59cdb91b5f7856","filename":"358749_hires.jpg","caption":"Tacos of Carnitas Roasted with Orange, Milk, and Pepper","credit":"Sara Remington","promoTitle":"Tacos of Carnitas Roasted with Orange, Milk, and Pepper","title":"Tacos of Carnitas Roasted with Orange, Milk, and Pepper","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.74,"ingredients":["3 pounds boneless pork shoulder (butt) or boneless country pork ribs","1 tablespoon lard","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/2 orange, well washed","1 cup whole milk","About 2 cups water","1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper","Warm corn tortillas","Diced avocado, lightly salted","Raw tomatillo salsa","Chicharrónes espumas (skin), crumbled (see note)","Diced white onion","Cilantro sprigs"],"prepSteps":["1.

In fact, they are relatives of the tomato and are a type of ground cherry. They are native to Central America. Fresh-tasting and excitingly tart, this chunky salsa is great on grilled meat, tostadas, or seafood.
