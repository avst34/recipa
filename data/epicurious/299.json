is native to the Andes, not the Middle East, so it was unknown to the Jews fleeing Egypt during biblical times. With the recent rise of quinoa's popularity in the United States, and the fact that it's not a true grain but rather the seed of a broadleaf plant, some circles of Judaism have approved of and welcomed it to the Passover table, while others have not. If you feel comfortable serving it this Passover, you will love how it absorbs the vinaigrette, bright with lemon and enriched with finely grated hard-boiled eggs, and how it forms a tender bed for the ribbons of scallion and raw asparagus.\nEditor's Note: This recipe is part of Gourmet's Modern Menu for Passover.

Increasingly, though, lamb legs are sold boned, or even better, boned and butterflied, which makes them ideal for summer grilling. But for Easter, a boneless lamb leg (readily available at the big-box stores) becomes something irresistible to stuff, and because there's no bone, it's a dream to carve.\nHere, we season the meat all over with a garlicky, lemon- and oregano-scented paste, then spread a flavorful, wilted-arugula filling over the lamb and roll it up. Don't be dismayed by the ragtag appearance of the uncooked roast. Just tie it securely and you will be amazed at how delicious it looks when it comes out of the oven. The vegetables surrounding the lamb not only absorb some of the lamb juices but also create a complete and nutritious meal in a roasting pan.\nEditor's Note: This recipe is part of Gourmet's Modern Menu for Easter. Menu also includes Frisée, Radicchio, and Fennel Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette; and Lemon Pudding with Strawberries and Meringue Cigars.","hed":"Arugula-Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Roasted Spring Vegetables","pubDate":"2012-04-04T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/arugula-stuffed-leg-of-lamb-with-roasted-spring-vegetables-395393","photoData":{"id":"54b1755ac6a78d1a4a60c3d0","filename":"395393_leg-of-lamb_1x1.jpg","caption":"Arugula-Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Roasted Spring Vegetables","credit":"Lara Ferroni","promoTitle":"Arugula-Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Roasted Spring Vegetables","title":"Arugula-Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Roasted Spring Vegetables","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Garlic","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced lengthwise","1 tablespoon olive oil","10 ounces baby arugula or baby spinach","Salt","7 large garlic cloves","3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano","1 tablespoon grated fresh lemon zest","2 tablespoons olive oil","Salt","Freshly ground black pepper","4 1/2- to 5-pound boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of fat on both sides and butterflied (from an 8-pound lamb leg on the bone; see Cooks' Notes:)","2 medium red onions, peeled and root ends trimmed, but left intact","1 1/2 pounds small (1 1/2- to 2-inch) red potatoes","1 pound medium carrots, peeled and cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces","2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided","Salt","Freshly ground black pepper","1 pound medium asparagus, ends trimmed and stalks cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces","Pan drippings from lamb","3/4 cup dry white wine","2 cups chicken stock or reduced-sodium broth","1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 3 tablespoons cold water","Salt","Freshly ground black pepper","Kitchen string; a heavy roasting pan; an instant-read thermometer"],"prepSteps":["In a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat, cook garlic in olive oil, stirring, until it begins to turn pale golden, then add arugula in batches, stirring and turning over with tongs until slightly wilted before adding each new batch, and continue sautéing until completely wilted, about 1 minute more.
