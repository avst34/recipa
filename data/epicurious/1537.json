Its long brown brittle bean-like pods each hold a sweet-sour sticky brown pulp containing up to ten seeds. Its flavor is akin to dates mixed with lemon and peaches.\nJust as we in the West often use a squeeze of lemon to lift the richness of a dish, in Asia they use tamarind. The American palate is not accustomed to the tamarind's particular brand of sourness, and so Western dishes using the fruit are usually tempered by ingredients that soften its acidity. In this dish, the heavy cream in the Smoky Plantain Crema balances the tamarind's acidity, while the chipotles complement the flavor of the grilled duck meat.\nWhen preparing this, note that the duck should marinate overnight.","hed":"Tamarind Barbecued Duck with Smoky Plantain Crema","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Norman Van Aken"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/tamarind-barbecued-duck-with-smoky-plantain-crema-108202","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Central American/Caribbean","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["3 whole boneless duck breasts, cut in half and trimmed (you can ask your butcher to do this)","1 recipe Sugarcane Marinade with Tamarind","1 recipe Smoky Plantain Crema","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",""],"prepSteps":["With a sharp knife, score the skin of the duck breasts in a crisscross fashion.

A basic recipe goes this way:\"You put in this and add that.\" If you don't want to taste the raw fish, add a bit more seasoning than you normally would. What makes this recipe Galicianer (southern Polish) is the addition of sugar. For some reason the farther south in Poland, the more sugar would be added. A Lithuanian Jew would never sweeten with sugar but might add beets to the stock. I have added ground carrot and parsnip to the fish, something that is done in the Ukraine, because I like the slightly sweet taste and rougher texture. If you want a darker broth, do not peel the onions and leave them whole.","hed":"Classic Gefilte Fish","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Joan Nathan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/classic-gefilte-fish-40014","photoData":{"id":"57bb35a1df05218810c52150","filename":"classic-gefilte-fish.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"classic-gefilte-fish.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.6,"ingredients":["7 to 7 1/2 pounds whole carp, whitefish, and pike, filleted and ground*","4 quarts cold water or to just cover","3 teaspoons salt or to taste","3 onions, peeled","4 medium carrots, peeled","2 tablespoons sugar or to taste","1 small parsnip, chopped (optional)","3 to 4 large eggs","Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/2 cup cold water (approximately)","1/3 cup matzah meal (approximately)","*Ask your fishmonger to grind the fish.
