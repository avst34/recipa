Baked in a standard light-colored metal pan, the cake was perfect; baked in a dark metal pan, however, it burned — be aware that the cake's high sugar content makes it more susceptible to burning at high heat. As you'll see in \"Tips: A Guide to Using Gourmet's Recipes\" (located on the recipe index page) we recommend always using light-colored metal pans for baking. Dark metal pans, including nonstick, will cause your baked goods to brown more quickly.

Put sealed jars on rack in canner and, if necessary, add enough hot water to cover jars by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, covered. Boil jars 20 minutes, then transfer with tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal as they cool (if you hear a ping, that signals that the vacuum formed at the top of the jar has made the lid concave).","After jars have cooled 12 to 24 hours, press center of each lid to check that it's concave, then remove screw band and try to lift off lid with your fingertips. If you can't, the lid has a good seal. Store in a cool dry place up to 6 months. Promptly put any jars that haven't sealed in the refrigerator and use them first."],"reviewsCount":1,"willMakeAgainPct":100}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:50:15.183Z","count":1944,"number":841,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=842&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=840&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
