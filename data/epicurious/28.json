(Precision is not essential here: I love the tiny, crunchy, almost-burned bits that emerge from the fryer.)","Soak the potatoes in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes, changing the water when it becomes cloudy (at least twice), until the water remains clear. (Soaking releases the starch in potatoes, making them less rigid and less likely to stick together while cooking.)","Drain the potatoes and wrap them in the kitchen towels to dry. (Removing the excess liquid will speed up the cooking time and reduce the likelihood of the potatoes splattering once the oil is hot.)","Transfer the potatoes to the saucepan and set it over the stove. Pour the oil over the potatoes. Do not cover the pot. Set the heat to high, stirring the potatoes gently with a metal spoon to distribute and prevent sticking. (A metal spoon lets you feel if any potato bits are stuck to the bottom of the pan and scrape them up.)","The oil should move from a peppy simmer to a boil in about 9 minutes. When the oil starts to boil, set a timer for 17 minutes. Stir the potatoes very gently every 3 to 4 minutes to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. Don’t worry about overboiling—the oil should boil rapidly and evenly with no need to adjust the heat throughout the entire process.","When the timer rings, the potatoes should have begun to take on color, turning from white to slightly golden, but will still have about 4 minutes remaining until they are fully cooked. For these last few minutes, watch them closely, stirring gently. When the fries are a deep golden brown, taste one to make sure they are truly crisp and firm on the outside with a creamy interior. They should not be the least bit soggy, so resist the urge to remove them from the oil too soon. When you are happy with the consistency, carefully transfer the rest of the fries with the wire skimmer or slotted spoon to the paper-towel-lined trays to drain. Season with salt and serve immediately on the warmed platter.","Use firm, fresh potatoes. Rinse and soak them well to rid them of starch. The less starch in the potatoes, the crispier the fries will be.","To keep the oil well contained in the pot, make sure there is at least 2 inches (5 cm) of room from the top of the oil to the rim of the pot.","We have made these fries in varied quantities with proportionate quantities of oil and pot size:\n1 pound (500 g) potatoes/1 1/2 quarts (1.5 l) oil/4-quart (4 l) pot\n2 pounds (1 kg) potatoes/2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) oil/5- to 7-quart (5 to 7 l) pot\n3 pounds (1.5 kg) potatoes/3 quarts (3 l) oil/7-quart (7 l) pot\n4 pounds (2 kg) potatoes/4 quarts (4 l) oil/8- to 9-quart (8 to 9 l) pot","Do not use an aluminum pot; it will not hold the heat in the same manner as a heavy cast-iron or stainless steel pot, and the results may not be satisfactory.","After frying, let the oil cool and strain it through cheesecloth into the original containers. Store in the refrigerator and reuse up to five times. Mark the bottles as to number of uses and sniff the oil before reusing; if there is any scent of rancidity, toss. Each time the oil is reused, add about 1 cup (250 ml) fresh, new oil to the mix."],"reviewsCount":4,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a4304619925f464b3834ac","dek":"A delightfully mustardy version of the battered and fried turkey, ham, and cheese sandwiches.","hed":"Monte Cristo Sandwiches","pubDate":"2017-03-07T17:27:36.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/monte-cristo-sandwiches-237911","photoData":{"id":"562fc4d5b09b90f62d803610","filename":"20151021_MonteCristo_Hero_6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Alex Brannian, Food Styling by Cyd McDowell","promoTitle":"","title":"Monte Cristo Hero","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Egg","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.83,"ingredients":["4 (1/3-inch-thick) slices egg bread","2 1/2 tablespoons whole grain Dijon mustard, divided","4 thin slices aged white cheddar cheese (cut to size of bread), divided","4 thin slices smoked turkey","4 thin slices smoked ham","4 leaves mustard greens (trimmed to size of bread)","2 large eggs","3 tablespoons butter"],"prepSteps":["Place 2 bread slices on work surface.

Then cut cucumber into matchsticks. Slice peppers into matchsticks. Cut chives to match the length of the vegetables. All vegetables should be about the same length and thickness. Cut each nori sheet in half crosswise.","To prepare sushi, hold the nori in one hand, shiny side down. Dip your free hand in a small bowl of water to prevent sticking.

Start rolling the sushi to the right to create a cone shape, using your free hand to tuck it all together tightly.

This dish is. Here, the meat is coated in toasted whole spices—fennel, coriander, and cumin seeds—that have been very lightly crushed. The seeds retain their texture, giving the meat both a heady scent and a good crunch. For serving, a tahini-lemon sauce adds a rich nuttiness, while a dash of sumac provides its berrylike tartness.","hed":"Turkish Lamb Chops with Sumac, Tahini, and Dill","pubDate":"2017-03-01T20:50:36.620Z","author":[{"name":" Melissa Clark"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/turkish-lamb-chops-with-sumac-tahini-and-dill","photoData":{"id":"58af7eae7c592624b115423e","filename":"turkish-lamb-chops-022317.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Eric Wolfinger","promoTitle":"","title":"Turkish Lamb Chops with Sumac, Tahini, and Dill ","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Lamb","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.67,"ingredients":["1 tablespoon Turkish red pepper or Aleppo pepper (or use red chile flakes)","2 teaspoons fennel seeds","2 teaspoons coriander seeds","2 teaspoons cumin seeds","2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste","1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","3 pounds bone-in loin lamb chops, the thicker the better","Extra-virgin olive oil, for grilling","1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)","2 to 3 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced","1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt","1 cup tahini","1/2 teaspoon ground cumin","4 to 6 tablespoons ice water","Fresh dill sprigs","Ground sumac (optional)"],"prepSteps":["Combine the Turkish red pepper, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds in a small bowl.

Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. Then add the tahini and ground cumin, and blend until a thick paste forms. With the processor running, gradually add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce is smooth enough to drizzle.","Heat a grill or broiler to high.","Drizzle the chops lightly with olive oil. Grill the chops until they are charred on the outside and cooked to taste within (or broil the chops on a broiler pan or rimmed baking sheet). Cooking time will depend on how thick your chops are, so watch them carefully: 2-inch-thick bone-in chops will take at least 3 to 5 minutes per side for rare. You’ll need less time for thinner chops, and more time if you like them cooked medium rare or beyond. Let the lamb rest for 5 minutes before serving.","To serve, drizzle the tahini sauce over the chops, and garnish them with the dill sprigs.
