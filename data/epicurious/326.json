Like salt, sugar is a flavor enhancer, and simple syrup is used to bring out the character of other cocktail ingredients. Its sweetness also balances acidic elements like citrus juices. Superfine sugar (also called bar sugar, a nod to its use by bartenders) is best for making simple syrup because the fine granules dissolve easily without heating.\nThere are two methods of making simple syrup: hot and cold. Most people are familiar with the hot method and do not realize that you can get the same result by simply stirring or shaking it. The cold method works only with superfine sugar. Standard qranulated sugar requires heat to thoroughly dissolve all the granules. Either way, the sugar and water proportions are the same—one to one by volume; because there is a lot of air trapped between granules of sugar, we recommend measuring by weight. For those who don't own a kitchen scale, we offer a volume measurement as well.","hed":"Simple Syrup","pubDate":"2011-11-09T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jason Kosmas "},{"name":" Dushan Zaric"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/simple-syrup-368890","photoData":{"id":"54f084fa4f77a310045da13c","filename":"EP-201502-simplesyrup2-6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle","promoTitle":"","title":"Simple Syrup","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Cocktail","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 1/2 pounds (3 1/3 cups) superfine sugar","2 cups water"],"prepSteps":["Combine the sugar and water in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Gather the dough into a ball, sprinkle a few drops of water over any remaining dry ingredients, and gather them together.

Pick it up on the rolling pin and slide it onto the pie dish or tart mold. Or, alternatively, fold it into quarters, lay it with the point in the center of the pan, then unfold.

Set the frozen tart shell directly into the oven, and bake until the crust has a \"set\" appearance and is just beginning to color, about 8-10 minutes. While the crust is baking, check to see that the bottom is not swelling with steam and air.
