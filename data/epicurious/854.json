Grimes, Haddonfield, NJ\nMy dad loved mushrooms, and he always ordered veal Marsala when we went out to restaurants. My mom didn't buy veal very often, so she adapted this recipe for chicken and made it on special occasions. He was also very fond of white Burgundy wine, which makes a wonderful accompaniment to this dish.","hed":"Chicken Marsala","pubDate":"2005-05-17T19:04:36.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chicken-marsala-232152","photoData":{"id":"54bac8092a4b69f8647e97ec","filename":"chicken-marsala-6x4.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"Chicken Marsala","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.77,"ingredients":["1 3/4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth (14 fl oz)","2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot","5 tablespoons unsalted butter","10 oz mushrooms, trimmed and thinly sliced","1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage","1/4 teaspoon salt","1/8 teaspoon black pepper","1 cup all-purpose flour","4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves (2 lb total)","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons dry Marsala wine","2/3 cup heavy cream","1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice"],"prepSteps":["Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.","Bring broth to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan over high heat, then boil, uncovered, until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes.","Cook shallot in 3 tablespoons butter in an 8- to 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until shallot begins to turn golden, about 1 minute.

Although my father came from Shanghai, he preferred the more flavorful Cantonese version my mother made. Breakfast with \"Baba\"(\"Daddy\" in Mandarin) on Sundays meant a table adorned with many small dishes of condiments. One of his favorites was \"thousand-year-old eggs\" (pei dan), which are actually chicken or duck eggs preserved in a mixture of clay, lime, and salt.\nThousand-year-old eggs are available at Chinese markets, where they're sold individually or in packs of six. (Don't confuse them with \"salted eggs,\" which are brined duck eggs.)
