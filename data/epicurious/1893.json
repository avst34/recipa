We've also added some tips of our own below._\n_\nFor a complete guide to Basque cuisine, [click here](http://eat.epicurious.com/eat/going_global/?/eat/going_global/basque/intro.\nhtml)._\nBeans have long been an important diet component from Asturias (fabada asturiana) to Toulouse (cassoulet). They are easily stored and in centuries past could enable a rural family to eat well during winter. Tolosa is a Basque town in Guipúzcoa, Spain, near the French border and San Sebastián. Known for manufacturing the familiar Basque berets, on Saturdays it also hosts a colorful farmers' market in the village square where visitors can sample local produce. Red beans of Tolosa are often referred to as black beans, and their cultivation is concentrated primarily in Guipúzcoa. The Basque consider this bean variety to be the best tasting that can be had. Tolosa has long been famous for its stews made of these local red beans. Periodically, the area's chefs have contests to vie for the recognition of preparing the best. As with many widely made classic dishes, the recipe for alubias de Tolosa will vary with each Basque cook; however, this version is fairly representative. The town of Gernika also lays claim to having outstanding beans for this recipe. This dish is often served with pickled guindillas, a pencil-thin, regional, spicy green pepper.","hed":"Red Beans of Tolosa Stew","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marina Chang"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/red-beans-of-tolosa-stew-109504","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Spanish/Portuguese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.4,"ingredients":["2 cups (1 pound) small red or black beans","4 tablespoons olive oil","1 pound pork ribs","1/4 pound salt pork or bacon","1 medium onion, chopped","3 cloves garlic, chopped","2 links chorizo sausage, whole or chopped in sections","2 links morcilla (blood) sausage, whole","Salt and pepper (optional)",""],"prepSteps":["Place beans in a large bowl or pot and fill with water at least 2 inches past the top of beans.

We've also added some tips of our own below.\nFor a complete guide to Basque cuisine, [click here](http://eat.epicurious.com/eat/going_global/?/eat/going_global/basque/intro.\nhtml).\nPorrusalda, or leek soup in Basque, is a very traditional dish. It includes pumpkins, an interesting component in a soup composed of both Old World (carrots, leeks) and New World (potatoes, pumpkin) ingredients.\nIn Spain, the first record of using potatoes as food was written in 1530. The families of Basque sailors along the Bay of Biscay were the first Europeans to grow potatoes in their gardens, and Basques fishing for cod introduced them to the Irish by the mid seventeenth century.\nPumpkins were widely eaten by native Americans from Canada to northern South America for centuries before Columbus arrived. European settlers in North America readily adopted them as a staple in their diets. The first definite record of pumpkins in Europe occurred in 1591. Pumpkins require a fair amount of hot weather for best growth and are successful in much of the Pyrenean region, unlike northern Europe.","hed":"Leek and Cod Soup","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Marina Chang"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/leek-and-cod-soup-109503","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Spanish/Portuguese","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1/2 pound salt cod","4 tablespoons olive oil","6 leeks, white and pale green parts only, chopped in 1/2-inch sections","4 cloves garlic, chopped or minced","4 potatoes, chopped in 1-inch pieces","1 medium carrot, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces","1/2 pound pumpkin, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup)","Salt and pepper",""],"prepSteps":["Soak the cod in cold water at least 24 hours in advance.
