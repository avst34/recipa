Divide each piece into 3 pieces, each weighing about 1.3 ounces (36 grams). Keep remaining dough covered while working with each batch.","Using lightly floured hands, roll 1 dough piece between palms to form smooth, 1 3/4-inch-wide ball. Pinch indentation on bottom of ball tightly to seal. Repeat to form remaining balls.","Transfer melted butter to small bowl.

Transfer rolls from baking sheet to rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.","•Dough rises best around 75°F to 80°F. If your house is on the cold side, you can set a container of very hot tap water near the rising dough and cover the dough and the hot water with a large plastic container or bowl—you will need to reheat the water every 30 to 40 minutes. Alternatively you can place the dough (and the small container of very hot water) in a microwave oven (not turned on) or a standard oven without a pilot light, but with the oven light turned on to provide gentle heat.\n•If you want to make this bread over a 2-day period, you can refrigerate it overnight after the first rise. Once it has doubled in size (first rise), gently press the dough down in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap that has been lightly coated with vegetable oil or nonstick vegetable-oil spray and refrigerate. After one hour and again after two, gently press the dough down. Then refrigerate overnight. The next day, bring the dough to room temperature at least 1 hour before shaping and baking the loaf. Keep in mind that the time in the refrigerator replaces the second rise so there is no need for a second rise.\n•For proper texture, it's important for the bread to get a blast of heat as soon as it goes into the oven. For this reason, the oven needs to be preheated for a full hour, and it's important not to let too much heat escape when you put the bread in. When transferring the dough to the oven to bake, be sure to shut the door quickly.","Flour: 100% (includes starch contained in the potato)\nWater: 64.9% (includes water contained in the butter and yam)\nYeast: 0.93%\nSalt: 1.7%\nButterfat: 4.4%"],"reviewsCount":8,"willMakeAgainPct":43}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:49:39.268Z","count":1944,"number":518,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=519&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=517&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
