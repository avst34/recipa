Come on, guys, it's the secret behind Buffalo chicken wings! Everybody loves wings, so alert your friends to come on over for a backyard wing feed. Make as many sauces as you'd like, and let each person embellish their wings the way they want.\nEach sauce makes enough to coat all 9 pounds of wings, so if you make all five sauces, you might want to downsize them, or make the full amount and use them in other ways. The vinaigrettes would be terrific as salad dressings, and the rest would punch up grilled or roasted pork or beef and do absolute wonders for tofu.","hed":"Chicken Wings Five Ways","pubDate":"2011-12-29T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Alexis Touchet"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chicken-wings-five-ways-388449","photoData":{"id":"54b42c36d5e8c3e1070b410b","filename":"388449_chicken-wings_1x1.jpg","caption":"Chicken Wings Five Ways","credit":"Chris Gentile","promoTitle":"Chicken Wings Five Ways","title":"Chicken Wings Five Ways","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.25,"ingredients":["9 to 9 1/2 pounds chicken wings (about 36 large)","3 tablespoons vegetable oil plus additional for grilling","Sauces to toss (see below)","Sriracha Buffalo Sauce","Lemon Pepper Garlic Vinaigrette","Balsamic Hoisin Sauce","Spicy Coconut Curry Sauce","Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette"],"prepSteps":["Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas); see Grilling Procedure below.","Cut off tips from chicken wings with kitchen shears or a large heavy knife (save to make chicken stock), then halve wings at joint.
