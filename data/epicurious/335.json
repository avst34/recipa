a special place in the lexicon of American layer cakes for the classic yellow cake with chocolate frosting. It's practically the standard for birthdays and anniversaries, so it was my top choice when creating a cake to celebrate the first year of publication of Gourmet Live. And if ever there was a version that will elicit either a string of excited OMG's or the low-humming purr of rapturous mmmm's, this is it. Tender, buttery cake layers sandwich a creamy frosting so light and airy it's as if you're nibbling a chocolate cloud. (No offense to dense, fudgy ganache-style icings—of which I'm also very fond—but they don't lend themselves to the kind of exuberant flourishes and swirls of frosting that convey the excitement of a first birthday.)

As true seekers of new ways to sedate each other with homebaked carbs, we flipped the Cinnabon on its noggin' one New Year's Day and whipped up what has become our favorite recipe for savory rolls. Take everything sweet about a cinnamon roll and invert it: soft sweet bread becomes tart and savory, gooey brown-sugar butter morphs into salty caramelized shallot goo, and frosting slumps into melted aged cheese. Yeah this will take a few hours to a day … but it will hurt your friends and lovers in the most wonderful way.","hed":"Savory Rolls","pubDate":"2011-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Alex Brown "},{"name":" Evan George"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/savory-rolls-367809","photoData":{"id":"54b29aa73edeef84363b0a97","filename":"367809_savory-rolls_1x1.jpg","caption":"Savory Rolls","credit":"Amanda Marsalis, courtesy of Mark Batty Publisher","promoTitle":"Savory Rolls","title":"Savory Rolls","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["(You will have leftovers)","2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour","2 cups filtered water","1/4 teaspoon dry active yeast","1 cup sponge (above)","1 large egg","1 teaspoon salt","1 teaspoon baking powder","1 teaspoon baking soda","1 teaspoon instant yeast","1 tablespoon brewer's yeast","2 cups all-purpose flour","1/4 cup water","1/4 cup melted butter (margarine works)","1 teaspoon olive oil","1 cup Cast-Iron Mushrooms","2 pounds shallots, sliced","1/2 cup cream sherry","2 cups chopped dill","1/2 pound shredded aged cheese (we use Comté)","sea salt and pepper"],"prepSteps":["1. Combine all sponge starter ingredients in a mixing bowl. The resulting goo should look wet and reckless. Wrap the bowl up and let it sit in the corner (preferably a warm one) for four hours or as long as overnight.","2. Combine all the dry ingredients for the dough in a large bowl or the mixing bowl for a counter top mixer. Mix them, mechanically or manually, so that all they are distributed evenly. Add water, one cup of the sponge, and butter and mix to combine.","3. Add the egg. You want to do this after the butter so the egg doesn't cook. Mix by hand for ten to fifteen minutes (three to five with a Kitchen Aid using the paddle on medium speed) until the dough forms a smooth paste. It should still be sticky and stretchy, but not very wet. If you're using a machine; switch to the dough hook and mix for another five minutes on medium; if you're manual, turn the dough out on a floured surface and knead the hell out of it for seven minutes.","4. In yet another bowl, add the olive oil and give a swirl. Form the dough into a ball, and roll it in the oil so that it's greasy everywhere. Cover the bowl with plastic and let it sit for an hour in a warm corner.","5. For filling, make Cast-Iron Mushrooms but add 2 pounds of sliced shallots. When the shallots begin to brown, add 1/2 cup cream sherry and reduce by half. Set aside.","6. Form the rolls: on a floured surface, gently roll out the dough into a 12 by 18 inch square. Spread the sherry-butter-shallot-mushroom goo all over the giant dough square on your counter. Make sure to spread evenly all the way to the edges. Apply the dill and the cheese in a similar fashion; evenly distribute all the way to the corners of your dough sheet.","7. Sprinkle salt and grind pepper all over the thing and preheat your oven to 350.","8. As if it were a joint—that's right—carefully roll the rectangle into itself. Start at the bottom and curl inwards until you have a bulging log. Use a sharp knife and slice rolls off of the left side of the log. You can make them as thick as you'd like; we like ours about two inches thick.","9.

Grilling a sack of onions down to a cereal bowl of caramelized noodles is a rare fall pleasure. And few pillars of French cooking are as widely and voraciously loved as scalding hot onion soup cloaked in a blistering layer of melted Gruyère. But like with many epic dishes canonized by the cuisine of rural folk, vegetarians usually remain wholly uninvited. So how does one mitigate the beef stock in every single recipe of the gooiest of soups? Our \"ah-ha moment\" was beer. After trying small batches of all three colors of the proverbial tricolore (blue, white, and red) we settled on Chimay Blue, a dubbel style beer that's become a household name for boozers. This so-called grande réserve, or any other basic dubbel, is a super substitute for the essence of animal gore. The malts and sugars play on your tongue in a way that's strikingly similar to the flavor of liquefied fat and tendon.","hed":"Belgian Onion Soup","pubDate":"2011-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Alex Brown "},{"name":" Evan George"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/belgian-onion-soup-367791","photoData":{"id":"54b29a833edeef84363b0984","filename":"367791_onion-soup_1x1.jpg","caption":"Belgian Onion Soup","credit":"Amanda Marsalis, courtesy of Mark Batty Publisher","promoTitle":"Belgian Onion Soup","title":"Belgian Onion Soup","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Soup/Stew","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.94,"ingredients":["2 tablespoons butter","2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil","5 large onions, halved and sliced thin","6 cloves of garlic, minced","4 shallots, sliced thin","750 milliliter Chimay Blue","4 cups vegetable stock","4 bay leaves","6 sprigs of thyme","1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper","4 slices sourdough bread for garnish","1/2 pound Gruyère cheese for garnish","Sea salt to taste"],"prepSteps":["1.
