On a trip to Rimini, a resort town on Italy's Adriatic coast, I had a memorable fried pizza topped with cheese and ham. To re-create it, I came up with this shallow-fry method in which you fry the dough, then flip it, top it with mozzarella, and cover it with a lid to melt the cheese. In honor of Rimini, I've topped this one with the region's famous squacquerone cheese, which is as deliciously soft and runny as it is difficult to pronounce. If you can't find it, you can use crescenza (also known as stracchino). It goes on after frying and quickly melts on the hot crust. I also add thin slices of the cooked ham sold in Italian delis as prosciutto cotto. Not to be confused with prosciutto, which is cured but not cooked, this is what we know as ham, but it's a bit paler, less smoky, and more delicate than typical American deli ham.\nFor this method, it's really helpful to roll your dough out as close to the stove top as possible and to have everything set up before you start cooking: your skillet on the stove top, a lid within easy reach, your cheeses and toppings measured out, and a plate lined with paper towels right next to the stove. Keep a close eye on the heat as you fry and adjust it as needed so the dough cooks all the way through without burning on the outside.","hed":"Rimini","pubDate":"2014-10-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Tony Gemignani"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/rimini-51255810","photoData":{"id":"54aaed2219925f464b39f68d","filename":"51255810_rimini_1x1.jpg","caption":"Rimini","credit":"Sara Remington","promoTitle":"Rimini","title":"Rimini","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 (8-ounce/225-gram) ball Master Dough , preferably with starter, made with Poolish","Semolina, for dusting","1/2 cup (112 grams) olive oil, or more as needed","1-1/2 ounces (45 grams) whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons)","1 ounce (30 grams) thinly shaved lardo","1-1/2 ounces (45 grams) squacquerone cheese","6 thin slices (2 ounces/55 grams) prosciutto cotto","Small piece young Pecorino Romano cheese, cold, for shaving"],"prepSteps":["Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator and leave wrapped at room temperature until the dough warms to 60°F to 65°F.","Line a large dinner plate with paper towels.

Over the course of a very grueling day, we competed for three Guinness World Records in front of a big audience and a panel of famous judges. I won two of the world-record rounds: Biggest Pizza Continuously Spinning for Two Minutes, and Most Consecutive Rolls Across the Shoulders in 30 Seconds.\nBy comparison, round three, the cooking challenge, felt as easy as pie. Four of us gathered at our stations to get our marching orders: create a gourmet pizza in ten minutes using none of the top ten toppings—no pepperoni, no sausage, you get the idea. So, my instinct was to combine two of my favorite pizza worlds, California and Italy. I grabbed five totally traditional Italian ingredients: prosciutto, fig jam, Gorgonzola, Asiago, and balsamic vinegar. They're classic, but the thing is, you'd never find them on a pizza in Italy, at least not all together. But to us \"why not?\" Californians, the combination makes perfect sense as a pizza topping, and it made sense to the judges, too.","hed":"Cal-Italia Pizza with Prosciutto and Figs","pubDate":"2014-10-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Tony Gemignani"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/cal-italia-pizza-with-prosciutto-and-figs-51255840","photoData":{"id":"54aaec9d6529d92b2c02f917","filename":"51255840_cal-italia-pizza_1x1.jpg","caption":"Cal-Italia Pizza with Prosciutto and Figs","credit":"Sara Remington","promoTitle":"Cal-Italia Pizza with Prosciutto and Figs","title":"Cal-Italia Pizza with Prosciutto and Figs","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["1 (13-ounce/370-gram) ball Master Dough , preferably with starter made with Poolish","1 cup (255 grams) balsamic vinegar","3 parts flour mixed with 1 part semolina, for dusting","2-ounce (55-gram) piece Asiago cheese, cold, for shaving","6 ounces (170 grams) whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (1-1/2 cups)","1-1/2 ounces (45 grams) Gorgonzola cheese, broken into small pieces","2 to 3 tablespoons (40-60 grams) fig jam, preferably Dalmatia brand","3 ounces (85 grams) thinly sliced prosciutto (about 6 slices)","2 pizza baking stones or steels, pizza peel"],"prepSteps":["Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator and leave wrapped at room temperature until the dough warms to 60°F to 65°F.

In two days, I tasted seventy-three pizzas, most of them too rich and fussy for my taste. Let's just say that almost every entry featured smoked fish, foie gras, gold leaf, or edible flowers. But one extravagant ingredient that I thought really did work was truffles, and that inspired me to come up with this pizza that makes the most of truffle paste, wild mushrooms, and two of my favorite French cheeses: nutty Comté and triple-cream Saint André. If you like, you can top the fully baked pizza with paper-thin slices of prosciutto or speck. And if you can get your hands on a fresh truffle, shave it on top right at the table.

I was excited to take her to Gombitelli, the tiny town in the mountains near Lucca where my dad's side of the family came from. My great-grandparents, Angelo and Olimpia Gemignani, had left Gombitelli for America at the turn of the last century, and my Grandpa Frank was born right after they got off the boat.\nWe meandered through the Tuscan countryside, following increasingly sketchy gravel roads and finally ending up on a narrow donkey trail that wound up the side of a steep mountain. I remembered this road from a visit I'd made seven years earlier. Since then, it seemed to have eroded and gotten even narrower. It was barely wide enough for a car, with a sheer drop along one side and, naturally, no guardrail. We came to a dead end, the front of the car facing a deep ravine, and an old man came out of his house, waving violently and screaming at us in Italian. I rolled down the window and said \"Gemignani?\" His expression changed from rage to joy as he motioned to follow him and raced off, back down the road, yelling \"Gemignani! Gemignani!\" I made the most terrifying U-turn of my life and followed him.\nThe minute I saw the little house and farm, I had the same overwhelming feeling I'd had the first time I'd been there. It was like stepping into my grandpa's farm in California. Although he'd never even been to Italy, he had the blood of a Tuscan contadino—and there in front of me was his backyard in every detail: the same flowers, the lemon tree, the dogwood, the fava beans, the big wine jugs wrapped in straw, the rusty tools scattered around. That California farm and my grandpa are long gone, but in that moment, I was home again.\nMy cousins had decided there was one thing they absolutely had to serve us for our welcome meal: pizza, of course. And this is the one they made. It was quite thin, almost like a toasted flatbread, and I've replicated that in this recipe by rolling the dough out and docking it, so you get a light, crisp crust that's just right with the gutsy puttanesca-style combination of crushed tomatoes, olives, garlic, and anchovies.","hed":"Lucca","pubDate":"2014-10-14T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Tony Gemignani"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/lucca-51255660","photoData":{"id":"54aae60f6529d92b2c02f1b1","filename":"51255660_lucca-pizza_1x1.jpg","caption":"Lucca","credit":"Sara Remington","promoTitle":"Lucca","title":"Lucca","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 (13-ounce/370-gram) ball Master Dough , preferably with starter, made with Poolish","2 parts flour mixed with 1 part semolina, for dusting","Scant 1/2 cup (100 grams) handcrushed tomatoes","10 oil-cured black olives, pitted and halved","1 teaspoon (8 grams) minced drained oil-packed anchovies","1/4 teaspoon (0.7 grams) minced garlic","Extra virgin olive oil, for brushing and drizzling","6 ounces (170 grams) whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (1 1/2 cups)","1 fresh basil leaf, rolled up lengthwise and cut crosswise into fine julienne","Dried oregano, for sprinkling","2 pizza baking stones or steels, pizza peel"],"prepSteps":["Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator and leave wrapped at room temperature until the dough warms to 60°F to 65°F.
