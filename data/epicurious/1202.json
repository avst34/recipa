(For a pie shell and lattice, divide it in a ratio of two thirds:one third — use about 9.5 ounces for the shell and the rest for the lattice, flattening the smaller part into a rectangle.)","Refrigerated, up to 2 days; frozen, up to 3 months.","A classic cream cheese crust contains no water and is more tender than an all-butter crust but not at all flaky. I have found it to be so tender it is impossible to use for a lattice top and the bottom crust often develops cracks through which a filling will leak and stick to the bottom of the pan. Very little water is needed, because the cream cheese contains 51 percent water. The addition of a small amount of water connects the two gluten-forming proteins in the flour, producing the rubbery, stretchy gluten that strenghtens the structure just enough to prevent cracking when the crust bakes. This pie crust does not shrink or distort as much as an all-butter crust because there is less development of gluten. The acidity of the vinegar weakens the gluten that forms, making the crust still more tender and less likely to shrink. If desired, it can be replaced with water.","Cream cheese is 51 percent water and 37.7 percent fat, so 3 ounces contain 1.53 ounces (about 3 tablespoons) or water and 1.13 ounces of fat. That means that the pie crust with 6.5 ounces of flour contains the equivalent of about 4 1/2 tablespoons of water. Compared to the all-butter crust, this crust has about 1 tablespoon more water, 1.13 ounces more of fat, and .34 ounce more milk solids. The extra fat in the cream cheese coats some of the proteins in the flour, limiting the development of gluten, which would make it tougher. The milk solids add both flavor and smoothness of texture.","The baking powder lifts and aerates the dough slightly without weakening it, but it also makes it seem more tender.","In developing this recipe, I found that if not using the vinegar and baking powder to tenderize the crust, it is advisable to add one quarter of the butter together with the cream cheese when using all-purpose flour. This helps to moisture-proof it but, of course, takes away a little from the flakiness, as there is less butter available to add in larger pieces to create layers."],"reviewsCount":33,"willMakeAgainPct":88},{"id":"54a455ec6529d92b2c022044","dek":"","hed":"Iceberg and Watercress Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/iceberg-and-watercress-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing-106354","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Salad","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.63,"ingredients":["1/4 cup mayonnaise","1/4 cup sour cream","4 oz blue cheese, crumbled (1 cup)","1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice","1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives","1/4 teaspoon salt","1/4 teaspoon black pepper","1 to 2 tablespoons milk or water","1/2 head iceberg lettuce, coarsely shredded","2 bunches watercress, coarse stems discarded (6 cups)","3 celery ribs, thinly sliced diagonally"],"prepSteps":["Whisk together mayonnaise, sour cream, cheese, lemon juice, chives, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and thin with milk or water to desired consistency.","Toss iceberg, watercress, and celery in a large bowl and drizzle with dressing."],"reviewsCount":36,"willMakeAgainPct":94},{"id":"54a455ec6529d92b2c02203d","dek":"","hed":"Pomegranate-Caramel Tart with Walnuts","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pomegranate-caramel-tart-with-walnuts-108858","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.5,"ingredients":["1 sheet frozen puff pastry (half of 17.3-ounce package), thawed","2/3 cup whipping cream","3/4 cup sugar","1/4 cup water","2 cups coarsely chopped toasted walnuts","2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses*","3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/4 cup pomegranate seeds"],"prepSteps":["Preheat oven to 375°F.
