I would stay with my grandmother in Cesenatico, hang out at the beach with my friends, and eat the wonderful food my grandmother cooked. I have never become accustomed to the traditional American breakfast of eggs and fried pork products, or even cereal. Some fresh bread with butter and jam and caffèlatte is my preferred breakfast, with the proportion of coffee to milk increasing as I have gotten older, from just a drop in a large cup of milk when I was little, to mostly coffee with a splash of milk as an adult. But even better than bread and butter is a breakfast sweet such as my grandmother's ciambella. She always seemed to have some on hand. It's very easy to make and keeps wonderfully on the kitchen counter for as long as a week. It may well keep even longer, but I've never been able to resist eating it for long enough to find out. The classic shape of a ciambella is a ring; in fact, there is a saying for when something doesn't work out: non tutte le ciambelle riescono col buco, which means, \"not all ciambelle come out with a hole.\" My grandmother always made hers in the shape of a loaf—it was no less delicious for it, and that is how I still prefer to make it.","hed":"Nonna Mary's Ciambella","pubDate":"2012-05-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Guiliano Hazan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/nonna-marys-ciambella-395729","photoData":{"id":"54b17b271cc76a014cfb0dad","filename":"395729_ciambella_1x1.jpg","caption":"Nonna Mary's Ciambella","credit":"Joseph De Leo","promoTitle":"Nonna Mary's Ciambella","title":"Nonna Mary's Ciambella","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.33,"ingredients":["3 cups all-purpose flour","3/4 cup sugar","2 tablespoons whole milk","2 eggs","1 tablespoon baking powder","1/4 teaspoon salt","12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter","Grated zest of 1 lemon","1 egg yolk"],"prepSteps":["1.

And if you are using canned tomatoes, all you do is open the can, pour it in the pot, and break up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. But it's not because of how easy it is that it's a favorite; it's because the flavor is addictively delicious. At our cooking school in Italy we offer a \"level-two\" course for those who want to return for more. I always ask what dish from the first course is their favorite. Out of a week of classes and restaurant meals, the majority say it is this sauce that they remember best.

Others are monogamous followers of specific flavors, like the one guy who comes in every day for a gallon of vanilla ice cream (for serious), or the devout woman who calls like clockwork to see if we have Rosemary's Baby.\nOne particular young lady was a big fan of Salted Licorice, and arrived promptly every time we had it in stock. After several visits, she came in one day bearing a gift: a bag of black, salty licorice that she brought back from Sweden. When Sean didn't register who or what she was, she became very insulted, threw the candy at him, and stormed off. As soon as she left, Sean remembered her and felt terrible. Angry Licorice Girl, please come back. Sean is very sorry.\nNearly everyone has a childhood reference to licorice. Salted Licorice reminds some guests of their travels to Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, where black licorice is ubiquitous. For other guests, Salted Licorice conjures up memories of chewy Red Vines in movie theaters. And it should, because we actually use Red Vines—the black ones, that is. Every once in a while, Sean stretches the truth by saying we use real licorice root. Technically, that's not incorrect…we just use real licorice root after it's been made into Red Vines. We're not afraid to be a little trashy. But not as trashy as Twizzlers. Those are gross.","hed":"Salted Licorice","pubDate":"2012-04-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jake Godby "},{"name":" Sean Wahey "},{"name":" Paolo Lucchesi"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/salted-licorice-395689","photoData":{"id":"54b1796ec6a78d1a4a60d08b","filename":"395689_licorice-ice-cream_1x1.jpg","caption":"Salted Licorice","credit":"Frankie Frankeny","promoTitle":"Salted Licorice","title":"Salted Licorice","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["2 cups heavy cream","1 cup whole milk","6 black Red Vines licorice, cut into 1/2-inch pieces","1 tbsp salt","3 egg yolks","1 cup sugar"],"prepSteps":["Fill a large bowl or pan with ice and water.

Alice Waters would be so proud of us . . . you know, if she knew who we were.\nDoing a flavor with miso was a natural and logical extension of our love for savory elements in our ice creams. Miso is a thick traditional Japanese soy paste that's often used as a condiment or a flavor ingredient in cooking, and it's been growing in popularity as an ingredient in desserts. Since miso is so salty, this is one of the few recipes in the book that doesn't call for added salt or vinegar.\nIn his search to get the flavors right, Jake went to a Japanese supermarket and bought pretty much every kind of miso in the joint: red miso, mixed miso, rice miso, purple miso, soy-only miso, miso-horny, and so on. He eventually settled on a white style. White miso is much more delicate than its counterparts. It's mellow. He still doesn't know what the label says, but boy, it sure gets the job done.\nWhite Miso is another \"Wow\" flavor, with distinct umami undertones that pair well with the seasonal tree fruits. It also goes secretly well with a scoop of Guinness Gingerbread, or simply a little splash of olive oil on top.\nInspiration: Jake used to serve miso apple butter with crepes and olive oil ice cream.","hed":"White Miso Peach/Pear/Apple","pubDate":"2012-04-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jake Godby "},{"name":" Sean Wahey "},{"name":" Paolo Lucchesi"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/white-miso-peach-pear-apple-395670","photoData":{"id":"54b179281cc76a014cfb05bc","filename":"395670_miso-ice-cream_1x1.jpg","caption":"White Miso Peach/Pear/Apple","credit":"Frankie Frankeny","promoTitle":"White Miso Peach/Pear/Apple","title":"White Miso Peach/Pear/Apple","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1 3/4 cups sugar, plus more if needed","2 large peaches, apples, or pears (we like Anjou), pitted or cored and cut into chunks.

In fact, we've overheard it so much through the years, we've even caught ourselves saying it unwillingly. We kinda hate it, because it goes with the presumption that you've already discussed that \"it\"—whether it's an ice cream flavor or party or whatever—is not going to be good.\nThe flavor that sparks the most customers to utter \"It's actually really good!\" is Candy Cap, a flavor made with…delicious little mushrooms.\nFirst some background: Porcini mushroom ice cream is one of the only flavor failures Jake will readily admit. It tasted OK, but it was just too earthy, and sadly, there was not a market for dirt ice cream. At least not yet.\nBut right when we were ready to write off mushroom ice cream, we stumbled upon a wonderful species called candy cap mushrooms.\nA local mushroom vendor, Far West Fungi, approached us about doing a mushroom flavor. At first we were pretty skeptical, and at second, we were still skeptical. But when they finally coaxed us to visit their shop at the Ferry Building, they opened a jar of dried candy caps. They smelled like the best maple syrup ever. We were sold.\nWe soon learned that nothing else on earth tastes like candy cap mushrooms. They carry the earthy taste associated with mushrooms, but unlike in the failed porcini experiment, candy caps deliver their own dimension of sweetness to the ice cream. Guests have said it tastes like waffles, pancakes, cinnamon buns, celery root, etc.\nWay more than just a novelty flavor, it's become one of our most popular flavors—it even got us on the television screen once or twice.","hed":"Candy Cap","pubDate":"2012-04-30T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jake Godby "},{"name":" Sean Wahey "},{"name":" Paolo Lucchesi"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/candy-cap-395669","photoData":{"id":"54b178da1cc76a014cfb04c1","filename":"395669_candy-cap_1x1.jpg","caption":"Candy Cap","credit":"Frankie Frankeny","promoTitle":"Candy Cap","title":"Candy Cap","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Milk/Cream","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["2 cups heavy cream","1 cup whole milk","2 tsp salt","1 tbsp dried candy cap mushrooms, ground to a coarse powder in a spice grinder (Chopping the dried mushrooms in a coffee grinder also works well and your next pot of coffee will be very special.)","3 egg yolks","1 cup sugar"],"prepSteps":["In a large, heavy-bottomed, nonreactive saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream, milk, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot but not boiling.
