And we couldn't be happier: We love the complex layering of flavors in real Mexican cooking. Mole, the signature sauce of Mexico, is a particularly delicious example of this trend. The only problem? Traditional mole usually requires a pantry's worth of ingredients and an entire day in the kitchen. Here, weve streamlined the ingredient list—and figured out how to make an incredible sauce in a couple of hours. But this simplified version doesn't skimp on flavor. Mexican chocolate adds an intriguing complexity to the smoky, savory sauce. Stir in some cooked, shredded chicken and you've got a whole new go-to chili.","hed":"Chicken Mole","pubDate":"2009-03-31T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jeanne Thiel Kelley"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chicken-mole-352649","photoData":{"id":"57892eac98e0fc8755001444","filename":"chicken-mole.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"chicken-mole.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Mexican","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.78,"ingredients":["3 tablespoons (or more) peanut oil (preferably unrefined), divided","5 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs","3 cups low-salt chicken broth","2 cups orange juice","1 1/4 pounds onions, sliced","1/2 cup sliced almonds","6 large garlic cloves, sliced","4 teaspoons cumin seeds","4 teaspoons coriander seeds","4 ounces dried pasilla chiles,* stemmed, seeded, torn into 1-inch pieces, rinsed","1 ounce dried negro chiles,* stemmed, seeded, torn into 1-inch pieces, rinsed","1/4 cup raisins","4 3 x 1/2-inch strips orange peel (orange part only)","1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano","1 3.1-ounce disk Mexican chocolate,** chopped","Chopped fresh cilantro","Warm flour tortillas"],"prepSteps":["Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.
