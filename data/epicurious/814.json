I wanted to give my larger 19-lb turkey a little extra zip by adding rosemary and other herbs to the miso butter. I used all of the butter under the skin, since my turkey was bigger and no basting is required. After rubbing the butter under the skin, I placed red bell pepper rings with a lemon slice in the center of each under the skin for extra flavor and a nice presentation. I also cook all of my turkeys in those clear oven roasting bags you find in the grocery store. I have never been disappointed — no basting, juicy, flavorful, nicely browned, and it cuts the cooking time way down! You don't need as much turkey stock because there is so much juice from the turkey. I like cornstarch for thickening because I like a more clear-looking gravy.
