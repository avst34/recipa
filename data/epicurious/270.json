is the stew that made such an impression on the final episode of the first season of Top Chef Masters. Each of us had been asked to create a meal that would be an autobiography told through the dishes we would present to the judges. I immediately thought of baeckeoffe (\"baker's oven\"). The name refers back to the time when bakers used wood-fired ovens. After the bread was done, this dish would be baked long and slow in the falling temperatures of the cooling oven. Since everyone in town would see the baker every day for the family's daily loaf, each would often bring a casserole to be baked in the oven. It was traditional, particularly on Mondays, when the women went to the river to do their laundry. They would have marinated their meats and vegetables overnight, dropped their casseroles off in the morning on their way, and then picked them upplus a loaf of breadon their way home. Even though my father was not the bread baker and had a modern, gasfired oven, people still took their casseroles to him. They liked to drop in because he always had some joke or story to tell. Before the village baker also invested in a modern oven and was still using wood, when my father turned over a fresh loaf of bread to give it the traditional blessing, he would sometimes see pieces of charcoal embedded in the crust. That would send my dad wild, muttering that \"he [the baker] did not thoroughly clean his oven!\"\nI make this dish often, both at home and at the restaurant. But these days we tend to increase the vegetables and use less meat, and sometimes we use only vegetables and leave out the meat entirely. While there is never a mushroom in the classic recipe, you can add them or make a vegetarian version with mushrooms and a rich vegetable stock. I've also made this stew as the centerpiece for Christmas dinner, adding plenty of sliced black truffles. The classic dish uses a mix of meats including a pig's foot, which gives a rich, gelatinous texture to the stew. You may be able to special-order a pig's foot. Ask the butcher to slice it crosswise into three pieces. But even at the restaurant I sometimes have trouble ordering them, and your stew will still be delicious without one. You can also use just one or two kinds of meat instead of all three.","hed":"Baeckeoffe / Laundry Day Stew of Beef, Pork, and Lamb","pubDate":"2012-10-17T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Hubert Keller"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/baeckeoffe-laundry-day-stew-of-beef-pork-and-lamb-51125400","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.11,"ingredients":["2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped","2 small leeks, white and pale green parts, finely chopped","1 large carrot, peeled and finely chopped","2 or 3 cloves garlic, very finely chopped","2 bay leaves","1 teaspoon whole juniper berries","1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme","3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flatleaf parsley","3 cups (one 750-milliliter bottle) dry white wine, such as an Alsatian pinot gris, plus more, if needed, for the pot","1 pound boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 1¼-inch chunks","1 pound boneless pork butt, trimmed and cut into 1¼-inch chunks","1 pound boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into 1¼ inch cubes","Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","","1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","4 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled"],"prepSteps":["In a large bowl or very large plastic bag with a secure seal, mix together the onions, leeks, carrot, garlic, bay leaves, juniper berries, thyme, parsley, wine, beef, pork, lamb, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.

In the town was a pâtisserie that made the best brioche with pastry cream. I would go to the shop whenever I could. The baker spread pastry cream over the dough, and then rolled it up like a biscuit rolé (jelly roll). My father made a brioche-and-pastrycream roll, too, but shaped it like a bretzel. Chantal still remembers them from the first time I brought her home to meet my parents—to do that you had to be serious.

Cut the dough into 12 evenly sized pieces (about 2 1/2 ounces each). Under cupped palms with stiff fingers, roll the pieces into tight balls.

Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for about 15 minutes.","To shape the bretzels, work sequentially, completing each step with all the dough. This allows the dough to rest and makes it easier to work. As you work, if the dough seems to fight you and doesn't stretch out, just let it rest for a few minutes and then continue. Line 2 baking sheets with nonstick baking mats or parchment paper.","Preheat the oven to 350°F. Roll each ball into a log about 6 inches long. Then roll each of these into a long, thin rope about 30 inches long, tapering the ends to points, and immediately shape it and arrange it on the prepared baking sheet.","To make the classic twisted pretzel shape, pick up the tapered ends of the 30-inch-long roll and cross your hands, right over left. The end that was on the right is now on the left. Repeat for a second twist. To complete the classic pretzel shape, lift the tapered ends and drape them over the sides of the bretzel, at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. You can leave the tips on top or flip the bretzel over, covering the ends with the sides of the bretzel. Either is correct. Your finished bretzel should be about 5 inches wide with very large openings to fill the pastry cream.","Meanwhile, scrape the warm pastry cream into a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. As soon as you have shaped a bretzel, pipe the pastry cream into the open spaces of the bretzels, overfilling them so the cream mounds above the dough. This helps prevent the dough from springing back on itself. With a wet finger, smooth any points left by the piping. Set the bretzels aside in a warm place to rise, about 30 minutes.","In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk with 1/2 teaspoon water. With a pastry brush, brush the dough only with the egg wash. Bake until medium brown, about 20 minutes, rotating the pans front to back and top to bottom about halfway through. Let the bretzels cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets.","Mix the powdered sugar in a bowl with just enough water to make a thin sugar glaze and brush it onto the breads. Let the bretzels continue to cool on the baking sheets until the pastry cream has firmed up. I like them best still warm from the oven (a privilege of living above a pastry shop), but they taste very good for the whole day."],"reviewsCount":0,"willMakeAgainPct":0},{"id":"54a425046529d92b2c00ad52","dek":"Our Granny Smith Apple Cider Vinaigrette is enlivened with fresh apple and a squeeze of lime juice.","hed":"Granny Smith Apple Cider Vinaigrette","pubDate":"2012-10-17T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Kay Chun"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/granny-smith-apple-cider-vinaigrette-51125210","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"occasion","name":"Thanksgiving","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.67,"ingredients":["1 chopped Granny Smith apple (with core and peel)","1/4 cup raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar","1 tablespoon fresh lime juice","1 tablespoon minced shallot","1 teaspoon raw sugar","1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon safflower or grapeseed oil","kosher salt","freshly ground black pepper"],"prepSteps":["Purée 1 chopped Granny Smith apple (with core and peel), 1/4 cup raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, and 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice in a blender, occasionally scraping down sides of blender with a spatula, until smooth.
