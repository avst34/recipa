Treat it gently so the dough holds its character, its texture. When you get around to shaping the disk for a pie, go easy as you stretch it to allow it to retain a bit of bumpiness (I think of it as blistering), so not all of the gas is smashed out of the fermented dough. I prefer to hold off on shaping the ball until just before topping it. If it's going to sit for a while—more than a couple of minutes—cover it with a damp kitchen towel to prevent it from drying out. I offer you two approaches for shaping. The simpler one, executed completely on the work surface, is slower than the second, where you lift the disk in the air and stretch it by rotating it on your knuckles.

This is a taste-great, feel-good classic Jewish brisket, but while the recipe has been in the family for years, Joan is not averse to a new tweak or twist: Add a jar of sun-dried tomatoes, dry or packed in oil, for a more intense flavor. Or add a 2-inch knob of ginger and a few large strips of lemon zest to the potremove them before serving. Note: \"Not Too Gedempte Fleysch\" means \"Not too well stewed.\" I didn't know either.","hed":"My Favorite Brisket (Not Too Gedempte Fleysch)","pubDate":"2012-02-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Stephanie Pierson"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/my-favorite-brisket-not-too-gedempte-fleysch-394570","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Jewish","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.78,"ingredients":["2 teaspoons salt","Freshly ground black pepper","1 (5-pound) brisket of beef, shoulder roast of beef, chuck roast, or end of steak","1 clove garlic, peeled","2 tablespoons vegetable oil","3 onions, peeled and diced","1 (10-ounce) can tomatoes","2 cups red wine","2 stalks celery with the leaves, chopped","1 bay leaf","1 sprig thyme","1 sprig rosemary","1/4 cup chopped parsley","6 to 8 carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal"],"prepSteps":["Preheat the oven to 325°F.

By making a meatless (pareve) version of chopped liver, Jews who keep kosher get to enjoy a much-loved dish while sticking to the dietary requirements of nonmeat meals. While this is often served as a Sabbath appetizer, particularly in homes with Ashkenazic roots, and also as a seder dish, novelist Ellen Levine brings it to the annual potluck picnic that gathers together writers and illustrators of children's and young-adult books from all over new England. It's always swiftly scarfed up.\nAs odd as it may sound to prepare a vegetarian spread whose name references an animal organ, somehow this dish lacks the turn-up-your-nose unpleasantness of many pseudo-meat dishes. Maybe this is because its origins are based in authentic foodways. But it could just as well be because it is very versatile and just plain good. as with all home-style dishes, from bouillabaisse to barbecue to gumbo, there are many versions of pareve chopped liver, and whichever one you grew up with is, to you, the one and only. I've attempted to give at least a nod to some of these variations following the main recipe, but this is my take on Ellen's. Try it as a sandwich spread or with crudités; or serve it with crisp crackers, toasted baguette slices, or, at Passover, matzoh.","hed":"Ellen Levine's Vegetarian \"Chopped Liver\" a la Dragon","pubDate":"2012-02-10T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Crescent Dragonwagon"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ellen-levines-vegetarian-chopped-liver-a-la-dragon-394531","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"equipment","name":"Food Processor","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["Vegetable oil cooking spray","1/4 cup olive oil, walnut oil, or a mild vegetable oil such as corn, canola, or peanut","2 large onions, chopped","3 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered","1/4 pound mushrooms, tough ends trimmed and discarded, chopped (about 1 slightly heaping cup)","1 1/2 cups fresh green beans, cooked to tenderness, cooking water reserved","1 1/2 cups lentils, cooked to tenderness","4 hard-boiled eggs, quartered","1 1/2 cups walnuts, toasted","1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional; Ellen doesn't use it, I do more often than not)","1 tablespoon mayonnaise","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","","2 to 3 tablespoons minced onion (optional)","Minced fresh parsley, for garnish","Paprika, for garnish"],"prepSteps":["1.
