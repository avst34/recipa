Put the beans in a bowl or pot and add enough cold water to cover. Set aside to soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours. Change the water once or twice, if possible.","2.

Reduce the heat to medium-low, skim off any foam that rises to the surface, and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the beans are nearly tender.

Using a slotted spoon, scoop some beans from the pot and put on top of each toast. Too much liquid will make the bruschetta soggy, so drain carefully when lifting the beans from the pot.","10.

You could cook your own instead of relying on canned, but for this puree I find the canned beans are just fine. And so much easier.

Guess what? I like it more as a small plate to kick off a meal than as a side. On the other hand, you could serve this in larger amounts as a side dish or even instead of a pasta course. And because the ragu is even better the second day, I make a lot, so you will have leftovers. Soft polenta, blended with plenty of cheese and butter, is lusciously creamy and becomes the delicious base for the meaty mushroom and sausage ragu. This is a terrific start to a fall meal of fish and a salad.

In general, crostini are more sophisticated and smaller. The bread slices for my crostini are about two inches across and thinner than those for bruschetta. When topped with great flavors, they fit the definition of a powerful tiny bite that by virtue of their size are less overwhelming than bruschetta. Crostini are always toasted, never grilled, and when you make them with the best, freshest bread available and sweet creamery butter, they become the ultimate garlic toasts. I pile everything on them under the Tuscan sun, even scrambled eggs at breakfast.","hed":"Rick's Basic Crostini","pubDate":"2007-11-26T04:01:08.000Z","author":[{"name":" Rick Tramonto "}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/ricks-basic-crostini-241049","photoData":{"id":"56746183b47c050a284a4e15","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_formal.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 2","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["3 garlic cloves","Pinch of kosher salt","8 tablespoons (1 stick) high-quality salted butter, softened","1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice","Cracked black pepper","Eight 1/4-inch-thick slices baguette"],"prepSteps":["1. On a cutting board, finely chop the garlic and sprinkle the salt over it. Keep chopping and smashing the garlic and salt together to make a paste. Use a wide-bladed knife so you can smear the paste along its flat side. You can also do this with a mortar and pestle.","2. In a small bowl, mix the butter, lemon juice, and garlic paste. Fold the softened butter over and onto the garlic mixture, mashing it down with the back of a spoon or spatula. Season to taste with pepper and continue folding.","3. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Scrape the butter onto the plastic and use the plastic wrap to shape butter into a log, encased in the plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use. If not using within 3 days, you can freeze the garlic butter for up to 2 months. Let the butter soften before using.","4. Preheat the oven to 375°F.","5. Lay the bread on a baking sheet and brush both sides with garlic butter. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, turning once, until golden brown but not too crispy. Let cool before using.","The difference between really good butter and all other butter lies with the butterfat content of the cream, which depends in large part on the cows and how the cream is handled before it is churned into butter. The best butter from Europe is made from raw or cultured cream and, particularly that made from raw cream, might not be imported to the United States. But never fear: At American companies such as the Vermont Butter & Cheese Company, the butter is made from high-grade cream (a high butterfat content) that is cultured and then churned. The butter is rich and flavorful and when it's salted, its salt content is significantly lower than typical salted butter. This is what I use in my crostini recipes, so depending on the salted butter you choose, you may not need to add any salt. As with all ingredients for these recipes, choose the best butter you can.
