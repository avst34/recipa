One such complimentary amuse bouche that we serve out Chanterelle clients as they sip their aperitifs and look over the menu is these little fritters, which come with a slightly exotic Tamarind Dipping Sauce. The restaurant staff likes them, too: After a long, late shift, when we often have snacks before we clean up and go home, we can't resist indulging in the fritters, although we usually dip them in hot sauce since there's rarely any Tamarind Dipping Sauce left in the kitchen.\nSweet Vidalia onions are harvested in the spring and are best at that time, when they're freshest. They can be found the rest of the year for as long as the supply lasts. If you can't find Vidalias, try another sweet onion like Maui (Hawaii) or Walla Walla (Washington). At other times of year you could use Spanish onions as a substitute.","hed":"Vidalia Onion Fritters","pubDate":"2008-09-08T06:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"David Waltuck"},{"name":" Melicia Phillips"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/vidalia-onion-fritters-243626","photoData":{"id":"560d79037b55306961bf3541","filename":"243626.jpg","caption":"Vidalia Onion Fritters","credit":"Laura Stolpman","promoTitle":"Vidalia Onion Fritters","title":"Vidalia Onion Fritters","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"French","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.22,"ingredients":["1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed","2 teaspoons baking powder","Coarse (kosher) salt, to taste","2 to 2 1/2 cups milk","2 large eggs","1/2 teaspoon white wine vinegar","1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce or chili-garlic sauce (sambal oelek)","2 large Vidalia onions, sliced lengthwise (top to bottom)","Canola or other vegetable oil, for deep-frying","Tamarind Dipping Sauce , for serving"],"prepSteps":["1.
