Finding ways to make impressive classic cuisine simpler and less technically demanding is the theme of many of the episodes. In the autumn of 2008, one of the broadcasts featured an innovative recipe for daigaku imo (candied sweet potatoes) that topped all previous viewer-rating charts. Indeed, as of this writing, nearly a year later, it remains the all-time favorite.\nSyrup-glazed, black sesame-studded sweet potato first became a popular snack among university students at the turn of the twentieth century. Indeed, that is the origin of the name of the dish: daigaku means \"university\" and imo is \"potato.\" Most recipes for daigaku imo instruct the cook to deep-fry sweet potato chunks first and glaze them afterward.

If the center of the pancake is very dry, dip the wayward bits in some fresh batter before \"gluing\" them in place.

If it comes out clean, continue to the next step.","Carefully arrange the soy milk-drenched mitsuba leaves or asparagus tips on the top of each custard.

Put a cup of water in a saucepan. Once the chorizo pan has cooled down to room temperature, strain off the oil directly into the water. Set aside the rendered chorizo.

Just as you feel the dough begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, transfer to a stand mixer with paddle attachment in place. Mix on low speed and add eggs, one at a time, waiting until each one is fully incorporated. This should form a nice, smooth dough that is slightly runny. Fold in chorizo and scallion. Fold in piment d'Espelette, to taste.","Heat a deep pot of unused vegetable oil to 385°F. Fry teaspoon-size balls of dough until very light gold and cooked through, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
