It's made in the style of many French fruit tarts: thin-crusted and only lightly sweetened to let the fruit truly shine. Americans have eagerly adopted French-inspired freeform tarts, even giving them a French name, galette, a word that the French generally use to describe a round, squat pastry, cookie, or buckwheat crêpe. The most famous galette is Galette des Rois, two disks of puff pastry filled with frangipane and eaten on Epiphany. I considered calling this dessert a tart, but decided against it because that term can put off people who are worried about dealing with fussy doughs and trying to achieve picture-perfect results. This pastry is intended to be rustic, and for that reason, it's often my go-to galette. Or tart.

Flash flying requires an oil temperature of at least 400°F—which means you have to use an oil with a high smoke point like grapeseed oil. By poaching the chicken first and then flash frying it, I was able to eliminate 20 grams of fat and at least 250 calories from traditional fried chicken. Because the chicken is already cooked, it only has to spend enough time in the hot oil to brown the crust, which means it absorbs less oil.","hed":"Flash-Fried Finger-Lickin' Chicken","pubDate":"2010-12-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Rocco DiSpirito"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/flash-fried-finger-lickin-chicken-363444","photoData":{"id":"56098f436a59cdb91b5f7946","filename":"363444.jpg","caption":"Flash-Fried Finger-Lickin' Chicken","credit":"Cookbook cover image courtesy of Random House","promoTitle":"Flash-Fried Finger-Lickin' Chicken","title":"Flash-Fried Finger-Lickin' Chicken","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["3 cups low-fat, low sodium chicken broth","Salt","4 skinless, bone-in chicken thighs","2 quarts grapeseed oil","1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour","1 tablespoon sweet paprika","1 1/2 teaspoon celery salt","1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper","2 cups low-fat buttermilk"],"prepSteps":["Heat the chicken broth in a medium sauce pot over high heat, seasoning it generously with salt.
