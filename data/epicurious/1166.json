Working in batches, pour the batter onto the griddle by 1/4-cup measures and cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden, brushing the griddle with some of the melted butter as necessary. Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof platter and keep them warm in a preheated 200°F. oven.","Serve the pancakes with the sautéed apples and the maple syrup."],"reviewsCount":46,"willMakeAgainPct":93},{"id":"54a45b8819925f464b3936fc","dek":"","hed":"Pepper, Rosemary, and Cheese Bread","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/pepper-rosemary-and-cheese-bread-12792","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"type","name":"Bread","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["a 1/4-ounce package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast","3 1/2 to 4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour","1 1/2 teaspoons salt","1 tablespoon dried rosemary, crumbled fine","1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper","2 tablespoons olive oil","1 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 3 ounces)","1 cup grated provolone (about 1/4 pound)","2 red bell peppers, roasted (procedure follows) and chopped fine"],"prepSteps":["In a large bowl proof the yeast in 1 1/3 cups warm water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy.
