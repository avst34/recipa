Cut the fat into the flour using a food processor, pastry blender, or 2 knives. (For pies with liquid fillings like custard or cooked fruit fillings that are thickened with cornstarch or tapioca, the bits of fat should be evenly small, and the mixture should resemble a coarse meal. This will result in a mealy pie crust, which is less likely to become soggy as the pie bakes. For pies to be filled with fruit or another nonliquid filling, leave some bits of fat in larger pieces, about the size of a small pea, for a crisp and flaky texture in the baked crust.)","Drizzle a few tablespoons of the ice water over the surface of the flour mixture and quickly rub the water into the flour. Continue to add the water, a tablespoon or so at a time, just until it holds together when you press a handful of it into a ball. The dough should be evenly moist, not wet, and shaggy or rough in appearance.","Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gather and press the dough into a ball, wrap well, and let chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.","Unwrap the dough, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and scatter a little flour over the top. Alternatively, place the dough between sheets of parchment or waxed paper. Roll out the dough for the bottom crust of a pie into an even round about 13 inches in diameter (for a 9-inch pie pan). It should be about 1/8 inch thick.","Fold the dough in half or roll it loosely around the rolling pin, and gently lift and position it over the pan. Unfold or unroll and ease the dough into the pan without stretching, making sure that the pan sides and the rim are evenly covered. Press the dough gently against the sides and bottom. Trim the overhang to 1 inch. Tuck the dough overhang under itself and flute the edges. Fill and bake the pie according to recipe directions.","Pie doughs may be soft and difficult to roll either because they are too warm, a little too much water has been added to the dough, or the weather is humid. Using marble pastry boards and rolling pins, which stay cooler than the surrounding air, helps to keep pastry dough cool and easy to handle. Another trick to working with pie dough is to roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment or waxed paper. This technique can be a big help to the novice baker."],"reviewsCount":2,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a42db06529d92b2c0119ec","dek":"Pair with Gaglioppo (Calabria)\nOctopus comes with its own braising liquid: just put it in a pot on the stove top, turn on the heat, and a couple of inches of water will soon appear at the bottom of the pot. It is a great little secret that a dish that appears so exotic is actually quite simple. Of course, any Neapolitan will tell you that the only octopus worth eating come from the Tyrrhenian Sea, and finding a Tyrrhenian octopus in California is a tall order. But we do have access to fresh octopus from the Pacific, which are a treat. If you cannot find fresh octopus, frozen ones are more widely available. Sometimes you will see frozen cooked octopus for sale, which are not the best option for this soup, though they will do. If you do use precooked octopus, decrease the braising time to 30 minutes and add about 2 cups water to the pot (the cooked octopus won't release sufficient liquid). And if you buy only octopus tentacles, you will also probably need to add water to the pot. Finally, I make this soup with the 4-pound specimens we get at A16, so if you can only find 2-pound octopus, you will need to buy a pair of them. Don't worry if they look large. They will shrink up as they release their water.","hed":"Octopus and Ceci Bean Zuppa with Escarole, Garlic, and Chiles","pubDate":"2009-01-12T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Nate Appleman "},{"name":" Shelley Lindgren"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/octopus-and-ceci-bean-zuppa-with-escarole-garlic-and-chiles-351349","photoData":{"id":"5609a4db6a59cdb91b5ff3b8","filename":"351349_hires.jpg","caption":"Octopus and Ceci Bean Zuppa with Escarole, Garlic, and Chiles","credit":"Ed Anderson","promoTitle":"Octopus and Ceci Bean Zuppa with Escarole, Garlic, and Chiles","title":"Octopus and Ceci Bean Zuppa with Escarole, Garlic, and Chiles","orientation":"portrait","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3,"ingredients":["1/2 cup dried ceci beans (chickpeas)","Kosher salt","2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing","6 cloves garlic, smashed with the side of a knife","Rind of 1/2 lemon, zested into strips using a vegetable peeler","2 bay leaves","1 (3- to 4-pound) octopus, defrosted, if frozen, and rinsed","1 head escarole (about 12 ounces), cored","3 celery stalks, thinly sliced","3 to 4 Calabrian chiles, stemmed and minced"],"prepSteps":["Pick over the beans, removing any broken pieces and pebbles, and rinse well.

The term applies when the main ingredient is a relatively large cut and the amount of liquid is relatively small. The moist, gentle heat gradually breaks down the meat to melting softness while releasing the big flavor that hardworking muscles develop. Beef brisket is one of my favorite candidates. The cut comes from just under the first five ribs, behind the foreshank. Large and stringy, brisket is usually sold cut into halves, one relatively square and the other tapering to a point. Both are delicious, but the point cut, as it is known, has more flavor because it is slightly fattier. Here I braise the meat in a combination of beef broth and red wine, with aromatic root vegetables and dried apricots, a popular Eastern European flourish.","hed":"Wine-Braised Brisket of Beef with Caramelized Pearl Onions and Dried Apricots","pubDate":"2009-01-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Wolfgang Puck"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/wine-braised-brisket-of-beef-with-caramelized-pearl-onions-and-dried-apricots-234062","photoData":{"id":"5674617eb47c050a284a4e11","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_bright.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 1","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.65,"ingredients":["5 pounds beef brisket","2 tablespoons kosher salt","1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper","1 bottle red wine","All-purpose flour","6 tablespoons vegetable oil","10 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed","6 large shallots, peeled and thinly sliced","2 medium carrots, peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks","2 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch chunks","1 medium leek, white part only, cut into 1-inch chunks","1 cup dried apricots","6 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley","2 sprigs fresh thyme","2 bay leaves","2 tablespoons tomato paste","2 quarts plus 1/4 cup homemade beef stock or good-quality canned beef broth","1 cup pearl onions","Minced parsley, for garnish"],"prepSteps":["1. Season the brisket evenly on both sides with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the wine to a boil and continue boiling until it reduces to half its original volume, 15 to 20 minutes.","2. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Evenly sprinkle the brisket all over with flour, shaking off excess. Heat a heavy Dutch oven over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil. When it is almost smoking, turn the heat to medium-high, carefully add the brisket, and sear until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the brisket to a platter.

To serve, use a sharp knife to cut the brisket across the grain into 1/4-inch slices.

So maybe my mother cooked with so much garlic to keep the vampires away from my sisters, my brother, and me. Actually, Austrians, like many Europeans, love the powerful bulb, and as a child I ate more than my share of it in soups, stews, sautés, roasts, and other savory dishes. But only as a professional chef did I learn the secret of roasting garlic. Because its texture is buttery and rich, I like to spread it on crostini. Once you've spread the roasted garlic over your toasts you can choose from a number of toppings.","hed":"Roasted Garlic Crostini with Assorted Toppings","pubDate":"2009-01-07T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Wolfgang Puck"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roasted-garlic-crostini-with-assorted-toppings-234057","photoData":{"id":"57eaa2165380fbcb1621ee2d","filename":"roasted-garlic-crostini-with-assorted-toppings.jpg","caption":"","credit":"","promoTitle":"","title":"roasted-garlic-crostini-with-assorted-toppings.jpg","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.6,"ingredients":["4 heads garlic","1/4 cup olive oil","12 slices of baguette or country-style Italian bread, sliced at a 45-degree angle about 1/2 inch thick","1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil","Pureed garlic from 4 whole roasted heads of garlic (see above)","Shaved Parmesan, dry jack or Gruyère cheese","Fresh, creamy goat cheese, at room temperature","Roasted red bell peppers, home-roasted or bottled, cut into thin strips","Prepared tapenade (black olive and anchovy paste)","Oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, cut into thin strips","Capers, drained","Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced, or halved, seeded, and diced","Fresh basil leaves, cut into fine julienne strips or left whole","Crushed red pepper flakes","Balsamic vinegar","Thinly sliced prosciutto","Anchovy fillets packed in olive oil, drained","Fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced"],"prepSteps":["1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Put the garlic in a roasting pan and drizzle on the olive oil. Toss to coat thoroughly.

Test by carefully giving a bulb a gentle squeeze while protecting your hand with a folded kitchen towel or an oven glove. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.","2. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut each head of garlic crosswise in half, midway between its leaf and root ends, to expose all the cloves inside. Their pulp will be golden brown and as soft as butter. You can squeeze it out of each half by hand or scoop it out with a small spoon or knife. Transfer the roasted garlic to a small bowl, pour in any olive oil from the baking dish, and stir and mash with a fork to form a smooth purée. You'll have 1/3 to 1/2 cup of purée, depending on the size of the garlic heads.","3. To make the Roasted Garlic Crostini, preheat the oven to 375° F. Brush the bread slices with the olive oil and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake them until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool to room temperature.

Spread some with 1 tablespoon each of goat cheese; then decorate the cheese with strips of roasted bell pepper or a mixture of sun-dried tomato strips and capers, or a smear of tapenade. In place of the goat cheese, top others with diced tomato tossed with some fresh basil, a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar; with prosciutto and Parmesan cheese; with anchovy fillets and freshly ground black pepper; or with slices of Roma tomato and fresh mozzarella, topped with fresh basil leaves."],"reviewsCount":7,"willMakeAgainPct":100},{"id":"54a438c919925f464b388d9a","dek":"Riz au Lait et Rosace d'Oranges\nThe great rice pudding revival taking hold of Paris is an oddly quiet phenomenon.
