Split the vanilla bean and scrape the seeds into the milk mixture. Add the pod and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and let steep for 30 minutes, or until the mixture cools to room temperature. Discard the vanilla pod or reserve for another use.","Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 300°F.","Lightly beat the egg yolks with a fork, then whisk into the milk mixture. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2- to 3-quart shallow gratin dish.","Place the gratin dish in a large deep baking pan or a roasting pan. Pour enough very hot water into the pan to come three-quarters of the way up the gratin dish. Bake for 45 minutes. Check the custard by gently shaking the dish; the custard should be set but still move slightly. Test by inserting a knife into the custard; it should come out clean and almost dry. If necessary, cook the custard for 5 to 10 minutes longer, checking often.","Carefully remove the gratin dish from the water bath. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours overnight.","Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler set over gently simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from the heat and let sit in a warm spot until tepid or barely warm. (If the chocolate is too hot when added to the yolks, the yolks could curdle; if the chocolate is too cool, flakes of chocolate may form in the yolks.)","The mousse is best made with a whisk or with a hand mixer; a stand mixer may not be able to whisk such a small quantity. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of the sugar until a slowly dissolving ribbon forms when the whisk is lifted. Fold in the tepid chocolate. In a medium bowl, using a clean dry whisk or beaters, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and continue beating until barely stiff peaks form. Gently fold half of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the remaining whites.","Spoon the chocolate mousse over the chilled custard, smoothing the top with a small offset spatula. Wipe the rim of the dish with a damp towel to remove any chocolate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or, preferably, overnight.","Thirty minutes before serving, remove the crème brûlée from the refrigerator.","Sprinkle the sugar in an even layer over the top of the mousse. If using a torch, work from one end of the dish to the other. Adjust the level of the torch as necessary to regulate the heat, moving the flame over the surface to caramelize the sugar. If using a broiler, place a rack on the highest level and preheat the broiler. Broil until the sugar is melted and caramelized, about 2 minutes.

Many expect a coffee bar that serves nothing but chocolate cake and cookies. While we do serve many kinds of desserts, Berkeley residents come more for the savory foods made with cacao nibs.\nArnon Oren, our first executive chef, created this fresh, memorable dish. Combining roasted squash with pancetta and crunch cacao nibs brings out the depth and sweetness of the squash, making it taste almost creamy. Prosciutto or any salty cured meat works well in this recipe.\n_","hed":"Roasted Squash with Nib Vinaigrette","pubDate":"2007-01-29T14:51:50.000Z","author":[{"name":"John Scharffenberger "},{"name":" Robert Steinberg"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/roasted-squash-with-nib-vinaigrette-237304","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chocolate","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["One 4-pound butternut squash, peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and seeded","1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","","1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar","1 1/2 teaspoons cacao nibs, coarsely chopped","1 shallot, finely minced","3 ounces thinly sliced pancetta"],"prepSteps":["Position the racks in the lower and upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F.

This marinade, based on the flavors of those spices, adds a wonderful savoriness and spiciness to beef. The thin slices of flank steak are wonderful on their own, with a basket full of warm tortillas, or served on top of a green salad.\nStart this recipe the night before you intend to serve to allow it to marinate overnight. To retain the steak's juiciness, be sure to let the meat rest before slicing, and remove the steak from the heat while it is still a bit rare, as it will continue to cook as it rests.","hed":"Chile-Marinated Flank Steak","pubDate":"2007-01-29T14:40:51.000Z","author":[{"name":"John Scharffenberger "},{"name":" Robert Steinberg"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chile-marinated-flank-steak-237303","photoData":{"id":"5674617e47d1a28026045e4f","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_casual.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 4","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Rhoda Boone","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Beef","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":2.2,"ingredients":["2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped","1 cup extra virgin olive oil","1/2 cup cilantro leaves, rinsed and patted dry","1/2 cup ancho chile paste","1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder","Juice of 2 limes","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","","One 2-pound flank steak","Lime wedges for serving"],"prepSteps":["With a mortar and pestle, or the back of a chef's knife, pound or mash the garlic to a paste.","Pour the olive oil into a blender, add the cilantro, and blend on high speed to purée.
