In that case, the impetus shifts from \"how can I do something as wonderful as this,\" to \"how can I make this better?\"\nThis sweet corn ice cream came from the latter impulse. The original dessert, sampled in a small Mexican restaurant, sounded unusual and intriguing, but turned out to be riddled with distracting icy bits of corn kernels. Still, I love the corn, and was taken with the idea of doing my own, perfectly smooth and silky corn ice cream.\nThis is the result. It is creamy-textured and luscious, with a subtle corn taste.
