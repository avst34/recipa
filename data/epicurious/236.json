This is one of my favorites. Although it is commonly prepared as a juice, it can also be a drinkable dessert, especially on warm summer days. I once had it as a \"salad\" served with a spoon in late fall in the eastern High Atlas. Oranges hadn't yet ripened, and instead the cook used small clementines from down the valley. Served before a communal platter of Berber Barley Couscous with Vegetables, the drink seemed closer to a light, sophisticated, vibrant green gazpacho than a rustic salad.","hed":"Chilled Cucumber and Orange Juice with Oregano","pubDate":"2013-06-03T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Jeff Koehler"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/chilled-cucumber-and-orange-juice-with-oregano-51173620","photoData":{"id":"54af469fc4a891cc44cccc5c","filename":"51173620_cucumber-orange-juice_1x1.jpg","caption":"Chilled Cucumber and Orange Juice with Oregano","credit":"Jeff Koehler","promoTitle":"Chilled Cucumber and Orange Juice with Oregano","title":"Chilled Cucumber and Orange Juice with Oregano","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"African","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["2 lb/910 g medium cucumbers","2 1/4 cups/530 ml fresh orange or mandarin orange juice, preferably clementine","1 1/2 tsp superfine sugar, plus more as needed","1/2 tsp dried oregano or zaâtar, plus more as needed"],"prepSteps":["Trim the ends from the cucumbers and scrub the peels.
