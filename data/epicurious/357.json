folks overcook grilled chicken breast, but it's not really their fault. The cut is too lean to stand up to lengthy cooking and too thick to cook through quickly—paillard to the rescue. A paillard (which means \"ribald\" or \"bawdy\" in French) is a boneless slice of meat pounded thin enough and wide enough to practically cover the surface of a large dinner plate. Because they are so thin, paillards grill through in seconds, so they are one of the quickest grilled meals one can imagine. They also look striking, flopping across a plate like an edible doily. In this recipe the lightness of the paillards is reinforced by a spare seaweed and cucumber salad with a Japanese-style vinaigrette.","hed":"Sesame-Crusted Chicken Paillards with Seaweed Salad","pubDate":"2011-05-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andrew Schloss"},{"name":" David Joachim"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/sesame-crusted-chicken-paillards-with-seaweed-salad-365450","photoData":{"id":"56043a43d55073c10c5b0489","filename":"365450_hires.jpg","caption":"Sesame-Crusted Chicken Paillards with Seaweed Salad","credit":"Alison Miksch","promoTitle":"Sesame-Crusted Chicken Paillards with Seaweed Salad","title":"Sesame-Crusted Chicken Paillards with Seaweed Salad","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Chicken","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":0,"ingredients":["1 cup rice vinegar (not seasoned)","2 tablespoons sugar","1 dried red chile pepper","1/4 cup soy sauce","3/4 ounce dried cut wakame seaweed","2 small Asian cucumbers, peeled and halved lengthwise","1 tablespoon kosher salt","4 red radishes, trimmed and cut into fine strips","2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro","2 scallions (green and white parts), thinly sliced","1/2 cup sesame seeds","4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 8 ounces each), washed and patted dry and trimmed of fat","1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil","Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper",""],"prepSteps":["Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and chile in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes.

Like most dark beers, Guinness has a bittersweet molasses flavor, which is great with lamb. But the hidden power of a Guinness brine is its alcohol content (about 4 percent). Alcohol accelerates the absorption of flavorful components directly into the protein structure of meat, yielding a steak that not only retains about 10 percent more moisture, but also is able to deliver a hit of seasoning with every bite. The flavors of chipotle chiles and cumin in the brine are reinforced with a smoky rub and a dark, pungent Guinness BBQ sauce. A word of warning: the sauce burns easily, so only brush it on the meat at the very end of grilling. In fact it is more flavorful served as a table sauce, although the steaks do look nice varnished with glaze.","hed":"Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks","pubDate":"2011-05-05T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Andrew Schloss"},{"name":" David Joachim"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/guinness-brined-bbq-lamb-steaks-365449","photoData":{"id":"56043a42968c2fa94dc98a0c","filename":"365449_hires.jpg","caption":"Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks","credit":"Alison Miksch","promoTitle":"Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks","title":"Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"ingredient","name":"Lamb","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.6,"ingredients":["2 cups Guinness ale","1 tablespoon coarse salt","1/4 cup sugar","1 cup water","3 tablespoons Smokin' Rub","3 pounds bone-in lamb leg steaks (see Know-How)","1 tablespoon canola oil","1 1/2 cups Guinness BBQ Sauce"],"prepSteps":["Combine the Guinness, salt, sugar, water and 2 tablespoons spice rub in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag.
