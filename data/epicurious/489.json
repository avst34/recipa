note: This recipe is adapted from Gabrielle Carbone, coproprietor of The Bent Spoon ice cream parlor in Princeton, New Jersey.\nThis pretty, striped cake can be assembled either from freshly made sorbet and ice cream or from leftovers. If you make the components fresh, it's helpful to have more than one freezer bowl for your ice cream maker or a self-freezing machine. If you don't, remember that some models demand that you freeze the bowl overnight between batches. You can make the batches on successive days, packing each flavor into the pan as it's done, then freezing the pan and the bowl until you're ready to make the next batch.\nTry to keep everything that you use in the preparation of this cake — even your cake stand or serving plate — cold. This will help the cake look better longer, especially on a hot day.\nThe simple, fresh flavors of the sorbets and ice cream don't need much embellishment, but crushed Newman's Own Organic O's (the organic take on Oreos) or chopped candied ginger make a nice addition and help separate the layers.","hed":"Red, White, and Blue Ice Cream Cake","pubDate":"2009-04-17T05:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Gabrielle Carbone"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/red-white-and-blue-ice-cream-cake-232354","photoData":{"id":"560de58f7b55306961bfd80c","filename":"232354.jpg","caption":"Red, White, and Blue Ice Cream Cake","credit":"Zoe Singer","promoTitle":"Red, White, and Blue Ice Cream Cake","title":"Red, White, and Blue Ice Cream Cake","orientation":"landscape","restrictCropping":false},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"American","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":4,"ingredients":["One recipe Simply Strawberry Sorbet","3/4 cup cookie crumbs (process 7 Newman's Own Organic O's — creamy fillings and all — in the food processor until finely ground) or finely chopped candied ginger","One recipe Lemon Ice Cream with Candied Lemon Peel","One recipe Simply Blueberry Sorbet","Freshly whipped cream, fresh berries, and sprigs of mint, for serving","fresh berries","sprigs of mint"],"prepSteps":["Place a 9-inch springform pan in the freezer until very cold, at least 1 hour.","Make the strawberry sorbet (or beat premade, frozen sorbet until smooth in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment).
