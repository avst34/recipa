Thick slices from the veal shank with its central marrow bone are key to osso buco, so that the meat remains moist and becomes tender enough to fall from the bone. When the dish is cooked ahead, the flavor will deepen and mellow. As for the curious gremolata flavoring of garlic, parsley, and lemon, I myself like to add a generous sprinkling to my veal at the table, although purists use only just enough for a delicate nuance. Risotto milanese, flavored with veal stock and saffron is the classic accompaniment.\nWine for Cooking Gavi di Gavi (sometimes labeled as cortese di Gavi) is Piedmont's best-known white wine. Gavi is no longer inexpensive, however, and oyu might do just as well with an Italian chardonnay, which is rapidly supplanting cortese as the most widely planted white grape in Piedmont.\nWine to Drink When osso buco reaches the table, an authoritative red from Piedmont is in order — a mature barolo or barbaresco, whose bouquet and will match the complexity of this Italian classic.","hed":"Classic Osso Buco","pubDate":"2004-08-20T04:00:00.000Z","author":[{"name":"Anne Willan"}],"type":"recipe","url":"/recipes/food/views/classic-osso-buco-105436","photoData":{"id":"56746182accb4c9831e45e0a","filename":"EP_12162015_placeholders_rustic.jpg","caption":"Menu Placeholder 3","credit":"Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Prop Styling by Anna Stockwell","colors":{"average":"#000000"},"type":"photo"},"tag":{"category":"cuisine","name":"Italian","url":"","photosBadgeAltText":"","photosBadgeFileName":"","photosBadgeID":"","photosBadgeRelatedUri":""},"aggregateRating":3.56,"ingredients":["4 pounds (1.8 kg) veal shanks, cut in 1 1/2-inch ( 4 cm) slices","1/4 cup (30 g/1 oz) flour","salt and pepper","","2 tablespoons olive oil","2 tablespoons butter","2 onions, chopped","1 carrot, chopped","1/2 bottle (375 ml) dry white wine","a 14.5-ounce (435 g) can plum tomatoes, chopped","2 garlic cloves, chopped","grated zest of 2 oranges","1 cup (250 ml/8 fl oz) veal stock, more if needed","3 or 4 garlic cloves","bunch of flat-leaf parsley","grated zest of 2 lemons"],"prepSteps":["1.
