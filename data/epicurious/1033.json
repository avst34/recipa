Stir in the oregano and the reserved clam liquid.","Preheat the broiler. Pack about 2 teaspoons of the crumb mixture loosely into each clam shell. (Remember that the clam, not the stuffing, is the most important part of this dish; stuffing should surround and enhance the clam, not overpower it.)","Place the clams under the broiler and heat through, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, just until the crumb mixture is deep golden brown; you're not really cooking the clam. Drizzle with a drop of olive oil, and serve."],"reviewsCount":7,"willMakeAgainPct":86}],"numFound":34975,"page":{"generatedAt":"2017-10-11T18:50:33.247Z","count":1944,"number":1033,"size":18,"totalCount":34975,"nextUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1034&xhr=true&q","previousUri":"/api/search/v1/query?size=18&content=recipe&page=1032&xhr=true&q"},"resultGroupDisplaySize":18,"spellcheck":{"requested":""}}
